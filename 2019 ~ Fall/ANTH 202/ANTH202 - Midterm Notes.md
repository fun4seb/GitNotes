# Ethnocentrism
> Ethnocentrism ~ Judging another culture by the standards of ones own rather than the standards of that particular culture

* Ethnocentrism has fueled centuries of efforts to change “other” people in the world, sometimes through religious missionary work, sometimes in the form of colonial domination.

## Cultural Relativism
* The opposite of this would be **Cultural Relativism** in which another culture is judged by the standards of its own.
* There is also **Absolute Cultural Relativism** in which you cannot judge or question other cultures from the context of your own for any reason.
* Absolute cultural relativism can lead to dangerous outcomes. Consider the Holocaust during World War II, the absolute cultural relativist position becomes boxed in, logically, to saying that because the Holocaust was undertaken according to the values of the german nazi culture, outsiders have no business questioning it.

## Examples
* Judging the amazonian culture negatively due to their **infanticide** practices
* Judging WWII-era germans for holocaust practices

# Leveling Mechanism
> Leveling Mechanism ~ an unwritten, culturally embedded rule that prevents and individual from becoming too wealthier or more powerful than anyone else

* Important process among small-scale societies and works to keep everyone equal
* May be maintained through social pressure and gossip
* Found in horticultural and pastoralist societies

## Examples
* When someone’s herd grows too large that person will socially pressured to sponsor a large feast in which many of the herd animals are eaten.

# Fallowing
> Fallowing ~ leaving soil unseeded for a season to promote healthy soil

* Fallowing is crucial in maintaining the viability of horticulture
* Allows the plot to recover lost nutrients and improves soil quality by allowing the growth of weeds whose root systems keep the soil loose

# Theory of Entitlement 
* Amartya Sen, an economist and a philosopher, proposed the theory of entitlements to explain why some groups suffer more than others during a famine

> Entitlement ~ culturally defined right to life-sustaining resources

* In every society, a person has a set of entitlements for example, a person might own land, earn cash from a job, be on welfare, or live off an inheritance.
* Entitlements vary depending on the type of economic system
  - In foraging societies, everyone has the same entitlement bundle. Entitlements are mainly direct, with the exception of infants and very old people who depend on sharing from group members for food and shelter
  - In industrial capitalist societies, entitlements are mainly indirect. People who grow all their own food are a small proportion of the total population, and even they depend on indirect entitlements for electricity and inputs required for maintaining their lifestyles

# Cultural Materialism
> Cultural Materialism ~ an approach to studying culture by emphasizing the material aspects of life, including people’s environment, how people make a living, and differences in wealth and power

# Interpretive Anthropology
> Interpretive Anthropology ~ seeks to understand culture by studying what people think about, their ideas, and the meanings that are important to them

# Early Hominins
> Basically early homos (erectus, sapien, etc.)

* Separated from other great apes from 8 million until 3 million years ago
* Lived in Africa
* Distinct from other apes because of:
  - Changes to pelvis and lower limbs to allow for
  - Habitual bipedalism
  - Larger brains
  - Smaller teeth

## Australopithecines
* Category of several extinct species found in East
and Central Africa
* Lived between 2 million and 4 million years ago
* “Lucy” famous because so much of her skeleton was preserved
* Era provides the first artifacts, in the form of stone tools, which indicate culture

## Archaic Homo
* Category of hominin species that lived from 2.4 million to 17,000 years ago
* More modern human-like body shape, larger brains, smaller jaws and teeth
* Stone tools are prominent
* Migrated into much of the Old World
* No clear evidence about whether they died out or interbred with later species

### Archaic Homo Migration
* Three major hypotheses exist for why archaic Homo left Africa:
  1. Had become meat-eaters and this preference led them to follow herds of animals out of Africa
  2. Were attracted by the cool and arid northern climate
  3. Were “natural” migrants

* The general direction of migration was north and east, out of Africa toward the Middle East and then on into Asia.

## Homo erectus
* First hominin species that was widely distributed across the Old World
* Highly successful in terms of duration (around 2 million years)
* Brain about 2/3 the size of the average modern human brain
* Acheulian tradition for stone tools:
  - Handaxe
  - Worked on both sides
  - More finely crafted and consistently shaped
  - The Early Hominins

## The Neanderthals
* Homo neanderthalensis was discovered in Germany
* Known from over 100 sites spread across Europe, into Israel and Iraq, and all the way to Siberia
* Survived from 400,000 to 30,000 years ago
* Compared with modern humans, had heavier limb bones, larger brains, and distinctive facial skeletons
* Able to tolerate the cold temperatures that affected Europe and Northern Asia
* In addition to biological adaptations, also developed cultural adaptations to the cold, including clothing
* Buried their dead and may have believed in an afterlife
* Stone tool kit referred to as the Mousterian tradition: smaller, lighter, and more specialized flake tools
* Had elements of expressive culture

### The Neanderthal Debates
1. Did they have the capacity for verbal language?
2. Did they go extinct or did they interbreed with modern humans?
  - Findings in 2010 indicate they did interbreed and that a small percentage of Europeans and Asians carry Neanderthal genetic material

# Modern Humans

## Modern Humans vs Neanderthals
* Modern humans lacked Neanderthals’ biological adaptations to cold, but they developed technology to produce “complex” clothing
* Anatomically modern humans (AMH)
  - Homo sapiens, the species to which modern humans belong
* Significant morphological changes
  - Steeper foreheads with smaller brow ridges
  - Smaller faces
  - Smaller incisor teeth
  - Thinner limb bones
  - More elaborate and complex culture

## The Upper Paleolithic
* The period of modern human occupation in Europe and Eurasia 45,000 to 12,000 years ago
* Technology included microliths and other small, finely made stone and bone tools, nets, and baskets
* A period of rapidly increasing cultural complexity, referred to as a cultural revolution or “Golden Age”

## Cro-Magnon People
* Archaeologists first discovered fossil evidence for modern humans at Cro-Magnon, a rock shelter site in Les Eyzies, France
* The Cro-Magnon people arrived in Europe around 40,000 years ago
* An impressive legacy of cave art and portable art
* May have had verbal language

## Modern Human Migrations into the New World
* Modern humans began migrating from Siberia to present-day Alaska 30,000 years ago
* Within a few thousand years had migrated throughout most of North America and into Central and South America
* An alternate theory proposes Europe as a source of migration

# Neolithic Revolution
* A time of rapid transformation in technology related to plant and animal domestication
* Developed tools such as sickle blades and grinding stones
* Began in the Old World in Mesopotamia, especially the Fertile Crescent

## Abu Hureyra
* Neolithic site located near the Euphrates
* A tell: human-made mound resulting from the accumulation of successive generations
* Occupied from 10,500 to 6000 BCE
* Stratigraphy of the tell provides the story of change during the Neolithic

## The Neolithic in Europe
* In Africa’s Sahel, the grassland regions south of the Sahara desert, a different pattern of domesticates emerged
* Foragers for thousands of years, combining fishing, hunting herd animals, and harvesting wild grasses
* Domestication of cattle was the first step in the transition to the Neolithic in Africa
* Relied on the introduction of plant and animal domesticates from the Middle East
* The first domesticates appeared in southeastern Europe around 6000 BCE
* Archaeological evidence for the later Neolithic shows social status differences, group ceremonies and feasts, and religious sites

## Domestication in the New World
* Began in Middle America (or Mesoamerica)
* Three distinguishing features:
  1. The first experiments with domesticated plants took place before sedentism
  2. The first domesticated plants were gourds, squash, beans, and maize, and the first animal domesticates were dogs, turkeys, and honey bees
  3. The transition to an entirely agricultural way of life was slower than in the Middle East, extending from 8000 to 2000 BCE

# Items of Exchange, Rituals, Modes of Consumption
* Two processes:
  - “Intake” in terms of eating or other ways of using things up
  - “Output” in terms of spending or using resources to obtain those things
* Related to modes of livelihood
* 2 major modes:
  1. Minimalism ~ few and finite consumer demands and adequite/sustainable means to meet them
    - examples of minimalists: **foragers** and **pastoralists**
  2. Consumerism ~ many and infinite consumer demands that are never satisfied
* Supply and demand promoted colonialism, spending for the sake of spends saw the rise of "luxury" goods
* Consumption varies cross-culturally
  - Foragers are generally egalitarian
    - Sharing within the group is the norm
    - Everyone has equal access to all resources
  - Most agricultural and industrial/digital societies exhibit consumption inequalities, some severe

## Consumption funds 
* Category of a personal or household budget used to provide for consumption needs and desires
* Five consumption funds:
  1. Basic needs fund
  2. Recurrent costs fund
  3. Entertainment fund
  4. Ceremonial fund
  5. Rent/tax fund

# Formal/Informal Sector (Industrial Production)

# Modes of Production
* A mode of livelihood is the dominant way of making a living in a culture
* Five modes of production:
  1. Foraging
  2. Horticulture
  3. Pastoralism
  4. Agriculture
  5. Industrial/Digital
* A particular mode may be dominant, but other modes may exist in a culture
* Modes can overlap and mix

## Economic Systems
* Includes three components
  1. Livelihood (or production)
    - Providing for basic needs and other needs by procuring goods or making money
  2. Consumption
    - Using up goods or money
  3. Exchange
    - The transfer of goods or money between people or institutions

## Foraging
* Based on using food available in nature by gathering, fishing, and hunting
* The main economic strategy for most of human history
* Maintains balance between resources and lifestyle
* Sustainable if undisturbed by outside forces

## Horticulture
* Growing crops in gardens using hand tools
* Variety of foods grown: yams, bananas, manioc, etc.
* Crop yields support denser populations than foraging and allow for permanent settlements
* Requirement for fallowing to provide sustainability

### Five Stages in Horticulture
1. Clearing
2. Planting
3. Weeding
4. Harvesting
5. Fallowing

## Pastoralism
* Reliance on products of domesticated animal herds
* Animals and their products provide over half of group’s diet
* Trade with other groups for other food and goods
* Requires movement of animals to fresh pastureland for sustainability
* Level of wealth and political organization varies from group to group

## Agriculture
* Intensive strategy of production
* More labor, use of fertilizers, control of water supply, use of animals
* Allows for and requires permanent settlements which lead to higher population density
* Capitalist and unsistainable due to high output and need for non-renewable resources

## Two types of agriculture
* Family farming:
  - Farmers produce mainly for their own needs but also for sale in a market system

* Industrial capital agriculture:
  - Financial capital is used to purchase machinery that replaces human and animal labor; produces goods solely for sale
