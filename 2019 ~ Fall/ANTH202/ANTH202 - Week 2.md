# ANTH202 - Week 2

## Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism

etho-centrism ~ judging other cultures by the standards of ones own culture rather than relative standards
cultural relativism ~ perspective that culture must be understand in terms of values and ideas of that culture and not judged by he standards of others

## Scientific Method

1. Testability
2. Verifiability
  * Testability relies on 2 methods of data collection
    1. Inductive: Observations and collection of data come firstm from this data a researcher develops a working hypothesis
    2. Deductive: A general theory is the starting point from which scientists develop testable hypotheses

Evidence derived from verifiable observation forms a **grounded theory**.

## Humanistic-Interpretive Approach

* Cultural anthropology uses this approach when conducting ethnographic research

E.B. Tylor defenition of culture: complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, arts, morals, laws, customs and any other capabilities and habit acquired by man.

> Evolutionism: Whereby culture is considered to evolve

## Culture vs Society

* Society: relational patterns among people in a given territory
* Culture: By-product of such relational patterns

## Enculturation

* Process of social interation through which people learn and acquire their culture including formal learning and unconscious informal learning

Three kinds of learning:

1. Situational learning: trial and error
2. Social learning: observing how others respond to stimuli and imitating or avoiding those behaviors
3. Formal learning: school

## Symbols

* System of shared meaning regarding elements in our environment such as:
  * Red = Stop
  * Green = Go
  * Emojis as a form of communication in modern society

Symbols and their underlying meaning can change durasticcly with context and usage. Ex: Sanskrit origins of the swastica with peace and goodness contrasting nazi usage which brings hatred and racism with its use

### Dress Code

* Symbolism of clothing and hairstyle communicates messages ranging from political beliefs to identification with ethnic or religous groups

## Culture: A relational process

* Culture consists of the shared practices and understandings within a society

> Schemas ~ Cultural Model that people use to guide their decisions

## Aspects of Culture

* Material Culture: referes to physical creations called artifacts and includes things like weapons, tech, living appliances, homes, etc.
* Non-Material Culture: Includes symbols, values, beliefs, norms **Non-tangable** aspects of society

## Non-Material Culture

* **Values:** Assumptions that are presumed to be widely shared
* **Beliefs:** Include cultural conventions that conern true or false assumptions uncluding description of the nature of the universe and our place
* **Norms:** Values and beliefs are inscribed and applied through a set of rules called norms. Regulate prescribed or proscribed behaviour in a given society*
  Ex: Prohibited behaviour within society that are norms to not conform againsts would be things like **sex with a minor**
* **Folkways:** Norms that guide ordinary usages and **conventions of everyday life that people conform to without thinking** about them to the point where these folkways become invisible: 'its just the way things are done' Ex: Spitting on random people for no reason **Guideways for behaviours**
* **Mores:** Much stronger than folkways in that they often involve a degree of punishment like ostracism, public ridicule, loss of job, physical beatings and imprissonment

> Hegemony ~ DEFINE

## Ideal vs Real Culture

* Ideal: What people say they do
* Real: What people actually do

**Inter/Intra Group Differences**

* Cultural relatavism **CAN** go to far such as someone being aquited of rape due to it being "in his culture"

## Food and Diverity

* Aesthetic experience
* Mechanism of sharing
* Mark of celebration
* Embodiment of ones ethnic, religous or regional identity

## Ethnicity

* Based on percieved differences in ancestral origins or descent, shared historical and cultural heritage
* An ethnic group is a collectivity of people who believe they share a common history, culture and ancestry
* Ethnic identy is very fluid

## Conclusion
