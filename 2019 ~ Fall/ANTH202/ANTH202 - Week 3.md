# ANTH202 - Week 3

## The Great Apes

* Category of large, tailless primates
* Locomotion by brachiation
* Modern humans and great apes share a common ancesto

* All great ape scpecies in the wild are endangered

> Social Darwinism ~ The smarter individuals in society become more succesfull

## Primate Characteristics

* Faces tend to be flat with small snouts
* Reliant on vision
* Have 5 digit on hands and feet and are capable with both 
* Large brains

## Nonhuman Primate Culture

* Evidence indicates that animals other than humans have aspects of culture
* In primatology, culture is defined as behavior that is learned and shared
* Example: Imo, Japanese primate
* Young primates learn cultural behaviors by watchind adults; intervention also occurs
* Example: JJ, a young male chimpanzee, transferred his skills using a stick to retrieve ants on the ground to obtaining them in trees
  - Not yet known if his invention will spread to the group

## Hominin Evolution to Modern Humans

## Early Hominins

* Separated from other great apes from 8 million until 3 million years ago
* Lived in Africa
* Distinct from other apes
  - Changes to pelvis and lower limbs allow for habitual **bipedalism**

### Australopithecines
- Category of several extinct species found in East and Central Africa
- Lived between 2 million and 4 million years ago
- "Lucy" famous because so much of her skeleton was preserved
- Era provides the first artifacts, in the form of stone tools, which indicates culture

### Archaic Homo
- Category of hominin species

### Hobo Habilis
- Fossils found in

### Homo Erectus
- Erectus means **"upright"**
- First hominin species that was widely distributed across the old world
- Highly successful in terms of duration (around 2 million years)
- Brain about 2/3 the size of the average modern human brain
- Acheulian tradition for stone tools:
  - Handaxe
  - Worked on both sides
  - More finely crafted and consistently shaped

### Archaic Homo Migration
- Three major hypotheses exists for why archaic Homo left Africa
  - Had become meat-eaters and this preference led them to follow herds out of Africa
  - Were attracted by the cool and arid northern climate
  - Were "natural" migrants

### Neanderthal
- First discovered in Germany
- Known from over 100 sites spread accross Europe
- Survived from 400,000 to 30,000 years ago
- First to Bury their dead
- Artefacts indicate they had art and music and had a belief of the afterlife
- Possible **rudementary** verbal language

#### Neanderthal Debates
- Did they have the capacity for verbal language?
- Did they go extinct or did they interbreed with modern humans
  - Finderings in 2010 suggest they interbread and that a small percentage of Europeans and Asians carry Neanderthal genetic material
- Why did Neanderthals die out and modern humans flourished?
  - Climate change
  - Modern humans developed more complex social behaviour and communicative skills
  - Domestication of large dogs by modern humans that aided in hunting efficiency

## Modern Humans
- lacked Neanderthals' biological adaptations to cold, but they developed tech to produce complex clothing

### Upper Paleolithic
- this period of modern human occupation in Europe and Eurasia 45,000 to 12,000 years ago
- Tech included microliths and other small, finely made stone and bone tools, nets and baskets
- A period of repid increasing cultural complexity reffered to as the cultural revolution or "Golden Age"

### Cro-Magnon People
- Archeologists first discovered fossil evidence for modern humans at Cro-Magnon, a rock shelter site in Les Eyzies, France
- The Cro-Magnon people arrived in Europe

### Modern Human Migrations into the New World
- Modern humans began migrating from Siberia to present-day Alaska 30,000 years ago
- Within a few thousand years had migrated throughout most of North America and into Central and South America
- An alternate theort proposes Europe as a source of...

## Neolithic Revolution and the Emergence of Cities and States

### The Neolithic Revolution

#### Abu Hureyra
- Relied on hunting and gathering and lived in permanent camps of 200-300 people
- Neolithic site located near the Euphrates
- A tell: human-made mound resulting from the accumulation of successive generations
- Occupied from 10,500 to 6000 BCE
- Stratigraphy of the tell provides the story of change during the Neolithic

#### Neolithic in Europe
- Relied on the introduction of plant and animal domesticates from the Middle East
- First domesticates appeared in southeastern Europe around 6000 BCE

#### Domestication in the new world
- Began in Middle America
- 3 Distinguishing features:
  - The first experiments with domesticated plants took place before sedentism

### Cities and States
- City is distinguished by having a large population (over 10,000), more occupatuional specialization, more elaborate architecture and central services

#### New World
- Formed later than in the Old World
- Though powerful and extensive, did not have writing
- Had elaborate contructed capital citiesm lavish political feasting, competitive sports, and wealth

#### North America
- Although complex societies emerged, they did not develop state-level institutions but remained as complex chiefdoms
- Mississippian cultures, dated to the first century CE, developed important trade centers

#### Civilizations are not forever
- All past states have gone through cycles of expansion anddecline followed by the rise of new states
- Why do states collapse?
  - Difficulty of maintaining territory and extreme social inequality of long periods
  - Environmental decline that accompanies state building and accumulation
  - Anthropogenic effects on the environment contributed to the collapse of many great and power civilizations
