## Alienation
Source of alienation in the modern world is that the worker (factory worker) has no control in the means of production. Artisan has some control over the role in production; shoemakers can chose materials, techniques, styles, etc. Humans are contrained to sell their labor. Work in the capitalist context is a form of survival, you need money to survive.

### Forms of Alienation
1. Alienation from product
  - Person working does not own or control any part of production or product 
2. Alienation from process of production
  - No control over ones own labor and not being able to express oneself through ones work because the process is not something the worker has a say over, no fulfillment or sense of pride
3. Alienation from self
  - One cannot fullfill oneself through ones work BECAUSE one is alienated from the process of production, work should be something one can express themselves through according to marx
4. Alienation from others
  - Under capitalist regime because of the capitalist structure, workers eventually feel alienated from each other, people see each other as competition. Competition fuels alienation from others in order to benefit ones own place in the capitalist heirarchy.
