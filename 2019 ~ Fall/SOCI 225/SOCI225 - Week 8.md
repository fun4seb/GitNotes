# Ideology
* **Stuart Hall**, cultural theorist
* Idealogies are "the framework through which societies represent, interpret, understand, and "make sense" of some aspect of social existence." (Hall 2003: 89)
* Group of shared ideas that are beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of a given society

## Media & Ideology
* Media: play a role in reproducing ideologies, including racist ideologies
* Naturalize ideas about races & ethnicities
* Examples of racist ideologies in the media: image of the slave, primitive, clown

### Hollywood Indian
* Key stereotypes depicted in hollywood films
* Often not even played by indigenous actors

# Nanook of the North
* While highly praised it presents alot of missinformation to sell the view as the "primative" indian, hunting with spears and disconnected from the modern world. Examples of this include:
  - Suggesting the Inuit only hunt with harpoon while they would have been using guns
  - Using language to suggest how mystifyied the eskimo are of the "white man" (saying they call the trading post the "big igloo")

# The Ethnographic Gaze
