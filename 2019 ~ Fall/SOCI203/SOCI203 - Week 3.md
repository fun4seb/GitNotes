# SOCI203 - Week 3

## Hunter-Gatherer Societies

### Flaws/Problems with such Societies

* Unsustainable in the long run due to dangers and frequency of mortality from preventable causes
* No way to store food for long term
* Unstable; **Society always craves stability**
* Problematic division of labour
* held to the limitations of a society centered around **mechanical solidarity**

> Mechanical Solidarity ~ Interdependance that arises from the similarity between individuals and their capabilities; Everyone is equally capable for the tasks challenged to the group, unfit individuals can have their place taken; interdependance is not fueled by individual specialization
  - Collectivity in mechanical societies is usually religiously based

> Organic Solidarity ~ Interdependance that arises from the specialization of labours like farming, carpentry, sewing etc.

Societies naturally progress from a mechanical solidarity focussed society like early hunter-gatherer tribes towards organic solidaritty focused groups like more advanced groups in towns and cities where everyone cannot know everything needed to maintin their society

the difference is not that it dissapears, its something that is not defined and aggreed upon by all society; we cannot realistically care about all humans, it is unreasonable

## Societal Cohesion according to Durkheim

* Durkheim focusesd on the basis of cohesion within societies ie: Religion, education
* Thought that changes in sactions signalled changes in the social conciousness

### Education

* Manifest function
* Socialization (identity formation, social skills, formed connection to community)
  - Very important to socialize the child population from an early age

### Religion

* Manifest function: go to place of worship and you worship god
* Latent function: exists independently of what you are worshiping and rather focused on the maintanance of societal cohesion

**Both Education and Religion's main function within society is to develope and maintain cohesion among a community; cohesion = healthy society**

> "Religion creates a moral cacoon around the individual" - Durkheim

* The specifics of a particular religion are irrelavant, the existence of religion to promote cohesion is whats imporant

* **Rituals dont have to be specifically religious, the function of religion can be transfered and valid in other social groups**
  - ex: comic-con, viewing parties, any pop culture community, etc.
  - **"Religion is society worshiping itself** -Durkheim

## Harriet Martineau

* First woman sociologist, fairly revolutionary for her time
* Interested in formulating a science of sociology, this is hard due to ambiguity and variances in interpretation with the social *"sciences"*
* She did not share the common conservative atitude towards social change; she was a *"positivist"*
* Travelled to the US to observe the state of American society. Made observations regarding slavery, state of women, stance on religion
* Believed in change through more long term educational reform
* Wrote **Society in America**, most notable achievment
* Often focused on the comparative nature between certain classes, races and groups to come to sociological conclusions about American society
* Warns against being esocentric in nature, the standards of one culture is not representative of the validity of other cultures
