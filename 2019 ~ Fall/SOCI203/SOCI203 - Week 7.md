# Symbolic Interactionism and Mead

* Most of what we deal with depends on the meaning we attribute to it
* We interact through role taking
* We are born with the potential to be human, we have to go through intensive interaction with close relationships to develop into a social being ie: human
  - This is the way we develop language and many other things
* According to Mead animals cannot think symbolically, therfor do not have culture

## Child Developement According to Mead

* According to Mead the first 18 months to 2 years of an individuals life is called the preparatory stage and is filled with meaningless imitation however many would argue this stage while filled with imitation, is far from meaningless
* At around 5 years of age children enter what Mead calls the "play stage"
  - Child show a more nuanced understanding of the world around them than they did before; girl plays mother with doll
* At around 10-12 kids internalize the expectations of other people which allows kids to play games and empathize with what others expect, this marks the "game stage" according to Mead or the **"abstract generalized other"**
  - Mead believes that the only thing that stops people from performing horrible things is the development of **empathy**
> Symbol ~ Something that signifies more than itself

1. Human Beings create and use symbols
2. Language

* Mead's 2 faces of self: the "I" and the "Me"
  - "What do i want" rather than "what do people expect of me"
* For Mead empathy is the rock on which the social world is built
