# SOCI225 - Midterm Notes

# Key Information

## Big Questions

* Look at films as sociological case studies
* To what degree does the movie connect **biography** (individual story), **social structure** (broader social forces) and **history** (larger historical forces)

## Movies and their Connections

1. To Kill a Mockingbird ~ "Sociological Imagination" C. Wright Mills
2. The Graduate ~ "Egoistic Suicide" & "Anomic Suicide" Emile, Durkheim
3. Roger & Me ~ "Communist Manifesto" & "Alienated Labour" Karl Marx
4. Food Inc. ~ "The Spirit of Capitalism and the Iron Cage" - Max Weber, "An Introduction to McDonaldization" - G. Ritzer

## Big Names

1. C. Wright Mills
2. Emile Durkheim
3. Karl Marx
4. Max Weber
5. G. Ritzer

# C. Wright Mills ~ Sociological Imagination

> Sociological Imagination ~  ability to see things socially and how they interact and influence each other. To have a sociological imagination, a person must be able to pull away from the situation and think from an alternative point of view.

* Use "Sociological Imagination" to consider:
  - **History + Biography**
  - How people fit into history
  - How history influences
  - Personal - larger focus
  - Awareness

# Emile Durkeim ~ Suicide & Functionalism

## Suicide

* Rejecting most of the accepted theories of suicide, Durkheim on the basis of his monographic studies claims suicide as primarily a social phenomena in terms of the breakdown of the vital bond of life. Durkheim in his classical study of ‘Le Suicide’ which was published in 1897, demonstrates that neither psycho-pathic factor nor heredity nor climate nor poverty, nor unhappy love nor other personal factors motivate along form sufficient explanation of suicide.
* According to Durkheim, suicide is not an individual act nor a personal action. It is caused by some power which is over and above the individual or super individual. He viewed “all classes of deaths resulting directly or indirectly from the positive or negative acts of the victim itself who knows the result they produce” Having defined the phenomenon Durkheim dismisses the psychological explanation. Many doctors and psychologists develop the theory that majority of people who take their own life are in a pathological state, but Durkheim emphasises that the force, which determines the suicide, is not psychological but social. He concludes that suicide is the result of social disorganisation or lack of social integration or social solidarity.

### Types of Suicide

* Egoistic suicide
  - According to Durkheim, when a man becomes socially isolated or feels that he has no place in the society he destroys himself. This is the suicide of self-centred person who lacks altruistic feelings and is usually cut off from main stream of the society.

* Altruistic suicide
  - This type of suicide occurs when individuals and the group are too close and intimate. This kind of suicide results from the over integration of the individual into social proof, for example – Sati customs, Dannies warriors.

* Anomic suicide
  - This type of suicide is due to certain breakdown of social equilibrium, such as, suicide after bankruptcy or after winning a lottery. In other words, anomic suicide takes place in a situation which has cropped up suddenly.

* Fatalistic suicide
  - This type of suicide is due to overregulation in society. Under the overregulation of a society, when a servant or slave commits suicide, when a barren woman commits suicide, it is the example of fatalistic suicide

# Karl Marx ~ Alienated Labour

## Evolution of Marx's ideas

* Developed and changed throughout his life as he moved and picked up new ideas

### Philisophical Position: **Germany**
  - Materialism

### Political Position: **France**
  - Class struggle
  - Was studying work of early French socialists
  - Witnessing class struggle in France becomes a very key element to his thought
  - Develops a more political angle to his ideas and theories that revolve around class conflict
  - Kicked out of France

### Scientific Position: **England**
  - Analysis of capitalist mode of production
  - Meets Engels !!
  - Most developed industrial country he had visited, this allowed his to flesh out a more scientific analysis of the capticalist mode of production that was much more prevalent in England than previous areas he had been

## Historical Materialism

* Historic development of a society = result of economic development
* Material condictions (economic conditions) explain non-economic phenomena
* Base: Economy
* Superstructure: Political, judicial & ideological elements
* History of humanity for Marx and Engels = History of materialism, almost always involve class conflicts

## Classes

* History = history of class struggles
* Social relationship
* 2 classes: **Bourgeoisie** and **Proletariat**
  - Social relationship, not static groups, are still affected by groups around them

> Bourgeoisie ~ In charge and control the means of production
> Proletariat ~ Laborors, viewed as commodities, only capable clsas capable of enacting revolution; Revolutionary Class

* Are result of intensification of capitalism
* With time: class consciousness of Proletariat

## Alienation

Source of alienation in the modern world is that the worker (factory worker) has no control in the means of production. Artisan has some control over the role in production; shoemakers can chose materials, techniques, styles, etc. Humans are contrained to sell their labor. Work in the capitalist context is a form of survival, you need money to survive.

### Forms of Alienation

1. Alienation from product
  - Person working does not own or control any part of production or product 
2. Alienation from process of production
  - No control over ones own labor and not being able to express oneself through ones work because the process is not something the worker has a say over, no fulfillment or sense of pride
3. Alienation from self
  - One cannot fullfill oneself through ones work BECAUSE one is alienated from the process of production, work should be something one can express themselves through according to marx
4. Alienation from others
  - Under capitalist regime because of the capitalist structure, workers eventually feel alienated from each other, people see each other as competition. Competition fuels alienation from others in order to benefit ones own place in the capitalist heirarchy.

# Max Weber ~ Capitalism & Modernity

* Interested in explaining capitalism and modernity, thought the protestant ethic was fertile ground for capitalism to flourish as making proffits in excess is not only allowed but encouraged as opposed to a more marxist model.

## Rationalization of Social World

> Rationalization/Rational Process ~ Broken down process in order to turn profit/ succeed in a capitalist model

1. Capitalism
2. Bueaucracy
3. Legitimate authority

Specific type of rational he called "instrumental reason" which has come to dominate social life rather than just economic life.

### 1. Spirit of Capitalism

* **Rational** pursuit of profit, what Weber dubs "spirit of capitalism"
* **Intrumental reason** dominates this form of profit, pursuit of profit involves being as efficient and cost effective as possible
  - Instrumental reason is at the heart of the spirit of capitalism
* Obligation to pursue profit - no longer a "calling" or a choice. Profitting in a modern capitalist model is essential to thriving

### 2. Bureaucracy

* Organizational form in capitalist society
* Highly specialized & hierarchical work
* High efficiency = high rationalization of organization
* Downside: dehumanizing sides

### 3. Authority

* **Rational-legal** authority reokaces traditional & charismatic forms of authority
* Authority in office, not specific person
* Power from laws, regulations, rules
* Rationalization replaces traditions, customs, etc.
* Example: Bureaucracy

# G. Ritzer ~ McDonaldization of Capitalism

## 4 Dimensions

1. Efficiency: optimal organization
2. Calculability: quantitative dimension; keeping costs as low as possible, quantity over quality, all about max profit with least effort
3. Predictability: uniformity and as similar as possible, **consistency**; "standards of sameness"
4. Control: controlling variables to manipulate the consumer; menu layout, lineup, etc. (slightly more innovative by mcdonalds part)

## Irrationality of Rationality

* Spread of rationalization through McDonaldization
* Darker side of rationality (ecological cost, labor costs, health costs)
