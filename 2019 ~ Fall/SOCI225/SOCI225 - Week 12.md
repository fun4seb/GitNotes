# SOCI225 - Food Culture

# Key Lecture Questions
1. What is authenticity when it comes to food?
2. Why is authenticity valued in foodie culture?
3. Why is authenticity valued more broadly? what role does it play in class politics?

# Foodie Culture
* Johnston & Braumann: foodie discorse & culture
* How does foodie culture work?
* What types of foods do foodies like, what do they seek
* What does that tell us about cultural consumption more broadly and its connection to inequality and class?

# Omnivorousness
* Bourdieu: Taste = form of cultural capital + how is it related to class position?
* The things we like, the things we do culturally produce and reproduce class
* His argument:
  - Hish culture > shows status (is related to higher classes)
  - Low/popular culture > does not demonstrate status (is related to lower classes)
* Today: more about eclecticism than what Bourdieu observed

* Cultural consuption today = more diverse
* Broadening of cultural repertoires BUT ALSO selective
* AND status is important
* Cultural capital: needed to know what types of culture are valued, and gives us status to those that are "in the know"

> Question: if people are consumer more broadly, how do they decide what is more valuable? Essentially what characteristics are they relating?

# Authenticity
* Important criterion for knowing what foods are "good" or valuable
* "Real" food
* Authenticity is socially constructed and relational
* Valuing of authenticity relates to broader class politics
  - Relate to why authenticity is valued so much in modern society

## Modern Value
* Connected to modern ideals: being tru to ones self, determinism, personal choice, etc.
* Being true to ones self, but also important to consider social side of authenticity

## Socially Constructed
* Not inherent to things - is about how things are percieved as "authentic" What are authenticity's qualities

## Geographic Security
* Foods from somehwere, not placeless foods
* Very specific references to place
* Foods that are restricted in production, like geographic indications

## Simplicity
* Honest, unprocessed, handmade
* Not too fussy
* Whole foods

## Personal Connection
* "Authentic food is about personal connection""
* Connected to someone special & creative like art is connected to artist
* Chefs, but also culinary artisans who are passing along family traditions

## History & Tradition
* History and tradition are what legitimates the food
* Cooked how is has always been cooked/how it should be cooked
* Historical tradition, usually enthno-cultural tradition
* Some creative/innovation injected into tradition makes more authentic

## Ethnic Connection
* People with ethnic connection to food make it more authentic (whether producers or consumers)

# Class Politics of Authenticity
* Key role of authenticity: helps to ease tension in contemporary culture between **democracy** and **distinction**
* Democracy = inclusiveness, equality - very important North American value
* Authenticity = opening up of tastes, thus is democratic in a way
* BUT also about distinction because produces and reproduces culinary world that is laden with hierarchies and elitism
* Deriving status from cultural consumption
