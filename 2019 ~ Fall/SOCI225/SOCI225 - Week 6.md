## Warm-up Questions

### Ways Our Current Food System is Efficient

* In terms of raw production it produces more than every human can eat; mass produced and easy access
* Nutritional info
* Variety and price
* Efficient use of time in production facilities

### Ways Our Current Food System is Inefficient

* Mass wastage
* Inconsistent access for lower income areas/regions
* Ethical treatment of animals
* Monoculture crop/lack of diversity
* Carbon footprint/ecological concerns (transport/globalization, production, etc.)
* Dependance on hormones, pesticides, steriods, etc.

## Weber

* Interested in explaining capitalism and modernity, thought the protestant ethic was fertile ground for capitalism to flourish as making proffits in excess is not only allowed but encouraged as opposed to a more marxist model.

## Rationalization of Social World

> Rationalization/Rational Process ~ Broken down process in order to turn profit/ succeed in a capitalist model

1. Capitalism
2. Bueaucracy
3. Legitimate authority

Specific type of rational he called "instrumental reason" which has come to dominate social life rather than just economic life.

### 1. Spirit of Capitalism

* **Rational** pursuit of profit, what Weber dubs "spirit of capitalism"
* **Intrumental reason** dominates this form of profit, pursuit of profit involves being as efficient and cost effective as possible
  - Instrumental reason is at the heart of the spirit of capitalism
* Obligation to pursue profit - no longer a "calling" or a choice. Profitting in a modern capitalist model is essential to thriving

### 2. Bureaucracy

* Organizational form in capitalist society
* Highly specialized & hierarchical work
* High efficiency = high rationalization of organization
* Downside: dehumanizing sides

### 3. Authority

* **Rational-legal** authority reokaces traditional & charismatic forms of authority
* Authority in office, not specific person
* Power from laws, regulations, rules
* Rationalization replaces traditions, customs, etc.
* Example: Bureaucracy

## McDonaldization

### 4 Dimensions

1. Efficiency: optimal organization
2. Calculability: quantitative dimension; keeping costs as low as possible, quantity over quality, all about max profit with least effort
3. Predictability: uniformity and as similar as possible, **consistency**; "standards of sameness"
4. Control: controlling variables to manipulate the consumer; menu layout, lineup, etc. (slightly more innovative by mcdonalds part)

### Irrationality of Rationality

* Spread of rationalization through McDonaldization
* Darker side of rationality (ecological cost, labor costs, health costs)

## Food Inc. (2008)

* Oscar-nominated documentary
* Narrated by Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma) and Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation)
