# SOCI225 - Gender

# Lecture Questions

1. What is "doing gender"?
2. How are childrens bodies dicipined to become gendered bodies?
3. How does Billy Elliot reinforce ideas about gendered bodies? How does it destabalize those ideas?

# Doing Gender

* West & Zimmerman (1987)

> Doing Gender: Gender viewed as a "routine, methodical, recurring accomplishment" (p.126)

# What is Gender?

* Is it a Variable?
* Is it a Role(s)?
* Is it a set of Traits?
  - Authors reject all of these options, none are sufficient in defining what gender is about

# Roles & Performances

* Role theory: gender as a "role"
  - Critique: roles are tied to specific contexts, gender is not
  - Reducing gender to role misses how gender might affect other roles and misses context
  - Roles are inssufficient to measuring gender
* Gender as performance: Erving Goffman
  - Critique: Gender an ongoing, routine activity, not just a performance
  - Performance of gender doesnt have one specific context says authors

# Doing Gender

* Gender as product of "social doing" (West & Zimmerman 1987)
  - For authors gender is inacted in someway as a set of specific normative behaviours that are associated with ideas about masculinity and femininity
* Gender is accomplished in micro settings of everyday social interactions
* Ongoing activity, part of everyday interactions
  - Gender is something one does
* Doing gender:"unavoidable" (W & Z 1987: 137)
* Doing gender naturalizes social arrangements, social order
* Ideological device: legitimizes existing gender hierarchies
* Gender is akin to an ideological device

## Doing Gender: Children

* Role of body in "doing gender"
* Everyday practices of the body: how they reinforce and maintain gender heirarchies assume as "natural" in our society

# Hidden Curriculum

* Bodily practices as hidden curriculum
* Hidden curiculum: rules, structures, routines that ar enot part of official curriculum in schools
* Martin's study: children's bodies are all disciplined, but girl's bodies are made more docile than boys' bodies

## Gendered Bodies Preschool Study

1. Dressing up (clothes, adornment)
2. Formal vs relaxed behaviours
  - Girls are made to be more docile through the diciplining of their bodies, girls as a result are more formal with their body behaviours
3. Voice
  - Boys are often louder with their voices and more forthcoming in making noise and expressing themselves vocally
4. Bodily instructions
5. Physical interactions with others (teachers & children)
  - More diciplining of the boys despite girls being more docile, physical intervention is much more common with boys
  - Self awareness is built up from a young age through social influences of formative figures and society

* Author finds there is a gendering of children's bodies that is happening in this preschool settings, the supposed "naturalness" of gender is cultivated and instilled very early in a childs life starting as young as preschoolers

# Billy Elliot (2000)

* Set in Northern, England, early 1980s
* Characters:
  - Billy
  - Michael (gay friend)
  - Jackie (his father)
  - Tony (his brother)
  - Mrs Wilkinson (ballet teachers)

## Notes

* Secondary themes of class conflict asside from gender roles
* Explores the idea of boys who do ballet/dance which conficts traditional gender roles that only women can do ballet
* Billy takes care of his grandma in the house, a nurturing role usually specific to women
* Billy has an internal struggled when starting dance, worrying about being a sissy or a puff
* Ballet teacher clearly much more well off than Billy's family
* Childrens are much more aware than authoratative figures realize, Billy's girl ballet friend is very aweare of the nuances of her parents's marital conflict ("they dont have sex", "dad did it with a lady from work" etc.)
* Billy expresses his anger and disatisfaction with the order of things through dance during the angry dance sequence, dance is an traditionally un-manly way to express ones feelings
* Billy is uncorrupted by strict gender notions that lead him to possess compassion and empathy for breakage of traditional gender roles held by people such as his father
* Billy's fathers acceptence as well as Tony and family friend poses as a heartwarming story element it is arguably unrealistic due to the context of the time. despite this the film is still an effective representation of current opinions on gender roles in a westernized society during the 20th century.
