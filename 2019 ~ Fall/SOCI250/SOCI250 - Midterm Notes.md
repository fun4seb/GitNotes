# SOCI250 - Midterm Notes

# Big Three (Marx, Durkheim, Weber)

* All three are concerned with modernity, and the various crises inherent in modern life. What is modern life? Capitalism as an economic system, high division of labor, the inventions of the "individual" with a split between public and private life, science replacing religion, etc.

## Karl Marx

* Karl Marx (1818-1883) was a German philosopher who believed that material goods are at the root of the social world. According to Marx, social life is fundamentally about conflict over food, land, money, and other material goods. Marx believed that the ideal government would be a communist state where resources are equally shared.

## Emile Durkheim

* Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) was a French sociologist who helped establish sociology by arguing that society had to be studied on its own terms — that understanding individual psychology was insufficient. Durkheim believed that societies are held together by shared values, which change over time as societies become bigger and more complex.

## Max Weber

* Max Weber (1864-1920) was a German sociologist who agreed with Marx that people often fight to protect their own interests, but he agreed with Durkheim that what people consider their interests often are determined by socialization and shared values. He believed society is becoming more rationalized and bureaucratic over time.

## Comparison Between The Three

* For Marx, the crisis is one of labor and profit: capitalism creates alienated labor and periods of overproduction and a collapse of profits, threatening to make the whole system implode.

* For Durkheim, the crisis is also one of alienation, but of a very different sort. He is worried about the way that modern life replaces old forms of social ties and community with more abstract and distant ones (and less meaningful for people).

* Weber is largely writing in reaction against Marx. First, he feels that Marx was too quick to downplay issues of culture and various social groups that are not class based. Second, he does not see the major crisis facing humanity as one of labor or community but rather excessive rationality. He is awestruck with the power of rational planning that made Germany a powerful country, but he is horrified by the process of bureaucratization and hyper-rationality that locks everyone into a dehumanizing system in which they are left feeling powerless. So, Weber sees the crisis of modernity as a crisis of rationality.

## Norms, Values, Beliefs, Expressive Symbols & Practices

1. Norms: way people behave
2. Values: what people hold dear
3. Beliefs: how people think the world operates
4. Symbols: representations of values and beliefs themselves
5. Practices: behavior patterns of people

## Definition of culture

> Culture refers to the expressive side of human life - in other words, to behavior, objects, and ideas that appear to express, or to stand for, something else.

## Explicit & Implicit Culture

* Explicit: expressive, symbolic forms; observable behaviours, rituals and symbols
* Implicit: grounding for action; underlying values and unwritten norms

## Cultural Object

* A cultural object is something that holds meaning relavent to the current society it inhabits; tells a story. A quilt as an object in a store is not a cultural object but a quilt that expresses womanly ingenuity and resourcfullness in tougher economic times **is** a cultural object
* Bread can hold much cultural meaning in regards to it being the staple to an entire generation of Americans following the baby boom generation. It connotates comfort and security within an American lifestyle and can be seen rejected during the 1970s with more anti-establishment sentiments that see white bread as an icon of Westernized convention
* Only when objects become public, when they enter the circuit of human discourse, do they enter the culture and become cultural objects; **All cultural objects must have people to recieve them**

## Cultural Diamond

Does not imply or indicate what the relationship between any of the points should be only that there **is** a relationship.

1. Social World
2. Reciever
3. Cultural Object
4. Creator

## Side Notes

* Society and culture is an intangible concept used to describe the way people live and have lived.
* "Cash Nexus" - coined by marx and refers to when in a capitalist model everything is evaluated on its economic benfit
* Weber set in his essay "Science as a Vocation" the limits of what science cannot do in order to explore what science can do.
* Geertz defined culture as "an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life"
* Many definitions of culture from highly specific (high art) to very generalized (the life practices of entire demographics)

## Reflection Theory

## Historical Materialism

> Central to Marx’s thought is his theory of historical materialism, which argued that human societies and their cultural institutions (like religion, law, morality, etc.) were the outgrowth of collective economic activity.

* Marx’s theory was heavily influenced by Hegel’s dialectical method. But while Marx agreed with Hegel’s basic dialectical thesis of social change, he disagreed with the notion that abstract ideas were the engine. Rather, Marx turned Hegel on his head and argued that it was material, economic forces—or our relationship to the natural, biological, and physical world—that drove the dialectic of change.
* Each “mode of production” in human history contained within it a flaw that will lead to its demise and replacement by a more advanced stage of economic and social life. The flaw inherent in feudalism was the necessity for states ruled by monarchs to trade with other states, thus creating a merchant class, leading to capitalism. According to Marx capitalism is flawed due to overproduction of goods as technology advances exploitation of workers continues.  The problem, according to Marx, is that overproduction produces crises for capitalism, crises that he felt would eventually lead to the development of communism.

## Functionalism

> "Human societies have concrete needs, and social institutions arrise to meet those needs. An Example would be **religion** as a tool for human collectivity and aids in social bonding.

* Functionalism interprets each part of society in terms of how it contributes to the stability of the whole society. Society is more than the sum of its parts; rather, each part of society is functional for the stability of the whole.
* Durkheim actually envisioned society as an organism, and just like within an organism, each component plays a necessary part, but none can function alone, and one experiences a crisis or fails, other parts must adapt to fill the void in some way.
* The different parts of society are primarily composed of social institutions, each of which is designed to fill different needs, and has consequences for the form and shape of society.
* The core institutions defined by sociology include family, government, economy, media, education, and religion.
* According to functionalism, an institution only exists because it serves a vital role in the functioning of society. If it no longer serves a role, an institution will die away. When new needs evolve or emerge, new institutions will be created to meet them.

### Problems With The Functionalist Model

* Assumes that these human beings are passive and without interests
* Model does not have a place for the independent influence of the organizations of cultural production, the record companies, church hierarchies, symphonies, art galleries, and so forth.

## Max Weber

* Weber is often contrasted with the theory of Karl Marx, especially when it comes to describing social stratification and social inequality. Unlike materialist Marx who saw everything in economical terms, Weber's theory of society tried to account for the manner in which various symbolic factors take part in establishing social status, stratification and inequality

### Protestents and Capitalism

* Protestent ideals compliment capitalist work ethic as protestents

* Weber argues capitalism developed to the advanced stage that it did due to the fact that Protestantism encouraged work as a calling from God, and consequently, a dedication to work that allowed one to earn a lot of money. This, combined with the value asceticism -- of living a simple earthly life devoid of costly pleasures -- fostered an acquisitive spirit.
* Later, as the cultural force of religion declined, Weber argued that capitalism was freed from the limits placed on it by Protestant morals, and expanded as an economic system of acquisition.​​
* Weberian model is basically that social action reflects cultural meanings
