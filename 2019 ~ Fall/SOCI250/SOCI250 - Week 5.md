  - Hint: recall Durkheim

## Durkheim
* Functionalist approach to culture BUT not just a straighforward reflection
* Societies create "collective representations" to bind them together
  - Culture is a reflection of the social world
* In Durkheims view religious gatherings and practices are collective (created and partaken by many) and come to represent the experiences of any particlular group
  - Collectivity is the key benefit and purpose of organised religions to Durkheim, regardless of content
* Cultural objects is collectively produced
* Cultural objects represent collected experiences of the people who created them
* **LOOK INTO DURKHEIMS VIEWS ON COLLECTIVE REPRESENTATION**
* **LOOK INTO THE CULTURAL DIAMOND**

## Bessie Smith - Early Blues Singer
* Singing about her personal experiences being a black person in 19th to 20th century that are representative of an entire group during her time
* Universal themes such as heartbreak
* Key example of collective cultural representation; creating music that vocalizes and represents a larger collective

## Collective Representation: Hip Hop Culture
> "Any identifiable social group will develop collective representations through which it demonstrates its collective solidarity to itself and others" (Griswold 2013: 54)

* Culture created from nothing that is representative of their own culture
* Adapted and morphed over time to fit the needs of the collective; as people started to dance at the breakbeat the beats became a more integral part of the culture

## Key Concepts: Symbolic interactionism
* We create meaning & identities through interations in everyday life
* Cooley: "looking-glass self"
  > A person's self grows out of society's interpersonal interactions and the perceptions of others. A reflection of how we think we apear to others
* Goffman: dramaturgical theory
  > A person's identity is not a stable and independent psychological entity, but rather, it is constantly remade as the person interacts with others. In a dramaturgical model, social interaction is analyzed in terms of how people live their lives like actors performing on a stage.

## Key Concepts: Subculture
> A subculture golds "a powerful set of symbols, meanings, and behavioural norams - often the opposite of those in the larger culture =-that binds the subculture's members" (Griswold 2013: 59)

* **Group within a group**, has distinctive characteristics that sepperate it from a larger group however still identify with foundational underlying ideas that characterized the group in the first place
* Identifying elements are not subcultures in themselves. ex: Doc martins are not a subculture but they may be part of punk subculture for instance
