# GEOG220 - Week 1+2: The Evolution of Human Geography Part 1

# Beginnings of Geography
- Basic points of the class:
	1. All **early/indigenous peoples** must have been geographers
	2. The earliest geographers used some very basic ideas to think about their world
- The Ancient Greeks are often cited as the creators of geography. **This is WRONG, knowledge of geography starts with the beginnings of humanity since everyone needs to know about their world to survive in it**
	- This is supported by cases such as the extensive geographic knowledge of indigenous and early peoples to navigate their environment

##  This Class Defines Geography As...
1. An interest in knowing where we are
2. An interest in describing the characteristics of the Earth
3. A knowledge of who/what lies beyond our own "world"

- This means that **all early/indigenous peoples were geographers, not just Europeans**
	- Europeans underestimated the geographic capabilities of indigenous peoples
		- This was perhaps because we didn't consider basic geographical skills as valuable
		- Preconceived colonialist ideas about "primitive" people blinded Europeans from recognizing the geographic skills of indigenous peoples. They often tried to rationalize how they could hold this expertise, theorizing the knowledge must be left behind from "lost civilizations"

# The Ancient Greeks
- The word ‘geography’ was supposedly coined by **Eratosthenes (273-193 BC)**
	- The “ge” part of the English word comes from the Ancient Greek **“ge” = the earth**, and **“grapho” = to describe**; **geography = "to describe the earth"**
- **The Greeks built off of older Mesopotamian ideas**; supports the case that geography did not begin with the Greeks

- The Greeks has **two** main geographic interests:
	1. Topographic description
	2. Mathematical (and astrological) observations

## 1. Topographical/Regional Description
> "Topos" = "place" ~ "To describe place"

- **Key example:** Herodotus, Greek author of "The Histories", wrote about the Greek's conflict with the Persians and included **descriptions about the Mediterranean world**

> Herodotus: “The Thracians [northern Greece] say that bees occupy the region beyond the Ister (Danube) and it is their presence that makes it impossible to travel through the land. But to me what they claim seems unlikely, since these creatures appear intolerant of frost. In fact, I think it is because of the cold that the regions under the constellation of the Bear are devoid of settled habitations.”

- Greeks were fascinated with whether or not the hotter parts of the world were **"habitable"** or not (will be discussed later). This leads to attempts to divide the world into **climate zones**

### Climate Zones
- Regional description lead to the belief that the world is divided into **5 climate zones, or "klimata"**, of which only temperate zones could support human life:
	1. Frigid (North Pole)
	2. Temperate
	3. Hot (Equator)
	4. Temperate
	5. Frigid (South Pole)

## 2. Mathematical & Astrological Observations
- Greeks knew the Earth was a sphere, but how did they know this?
	- One way was by observing how ships disappeared over the horizon
- "Sophistication of concepts **did not depend on a lot of advanced technology, but could be reached with basic intuition and theory**"

- Most important figures:
		1. **Eratosthenes (273-193 BC)**
			- **He calculated the circumference of the world at 40,000 km**
			- He produced one of the earliest "maps" of the known world
		2. **Ptolemy (90-168 AD)**
			-  **Utilized the ability to estimate latitude and longitude to calculate positions of places on a sphere the size Eratosthenes calculated**
			- Ptolemy's "Atlas" of the known world is based off Eratosthenes calculations which assume a circular world of 360°

# Eratosthenes and the Earth's Circumference
- Eratosthenes worked at the library of Alexandria, and **started with the assumption the earth was a round sphere**
- He was told that at noon on midsummer's day, the sun is **directly overhead** at a place called **Syene** and thus leaves no shadow, YET AT THE SAME TIME, the sun is at a **slight angle** when seen from **Alexandria**
	- If the sun casts different shadows depending on your position on Earth, then that must mean there is some form of curvature to the world **i.e. it is round**

- Once you know the size of the Earth, you can begin to figure out where you are, and draw the first “world maps”
	- **Latitude** can be crudely estimated by **length of day**
	- **Longitude** can be crudely measured by **travel distances (paces)**
- Understanding the size of the Earth allowed the Greeks to situate themselves within the scale of the globe and see what is **unknown**

## Eratosthenes' Errors
- **WILL BE TESTED ON THIS**

1. Syene is not on the Tropic of Cancer (where the sun rays are directly overhead during the solstice), the sun would not have been directly overhead Syene as a result
2. Alexandria is not due north of Syene
3. The known distance between the two points at the time was not reliable

# Reading Notes: A New Perspective on Eratosthenes’ Measurement of the Earth - Brown & Kumar (2011)
> Around 240 B.C., Eratosthenes made what is considered to be the most famous and accurate of the ancient measurements of the circumference of the Earth. It was accomplished by making presumably simultaneous measurements of the angles of the shadows cast by a vertical stick at Syene (today known as Aswan) and another at Alexandria, at noon on the day of the summer solstice (about June 21 every year). From these measurements, and knowing the distance from Syene to Alexandria along the assumed same meridian of longitude, Eratosthenes was able to provide a remarkably accurate estimate of the radius of the Earth.

- Measurements at Alexandria and Syene were assumed to have been taken **simultaneously**, a feat which seems impossible for the times. Eratosthenes probably utilized a **minimization procedure** to measure both points simultaneously from one single point using knowledge available at the time

> ... the present authors suggest a minimization procedure that could have allowed Eratosthenes to make the two simultaneous measurements between points 5000 stadia apart, at Syene and at Alexandria, while staying at one point, using only information that was known at the time. All that was required was for Eratosthenes to have set up a stick at Alexandria on the day of the summer solstice and to have measured the angle of its shadow when that shadow was at its shortest (minimum). 

- Eratosthenes made some small errors when measuring the longitude and latitude of his points, **these account for a 2% error in his overall calculations of the size of the earth**
	1. Eratosthenes assumed Syene and Alexandria lie along the same meridian of longitude
		- **Alexandria does not lie due north of Syene**, they have a difference in longitude of ~3°, however the consequences of this assumption is small (0.14%)
	2. Eratosthenes made an error in measuring the latitude of Alexandria, thus the difference in latitudes between Alexandria and Syene were off
	3. Surveyors who measured the distance between Alexandria and Syene would have followed the Nile (irregularly shaped), rather than a straight path and as a result would have most likely overestimated the distance; **Eratosthenes distance measurements were not reliable**

# Reading Notes: Medieval Mappamundi
> Medieval Mappamundi ~ Medieval depiction of the world through map; while often inaccurate such maps outline how certain influences (such as religious lore) can affect ones preconceived understanding of their world

- Medieval maps were previously looked down upon as a sign of **"intellectual regression"** followed the collapse of the Roman Empire; They were judged for their lack of accuracy rather than their cultural value as historic lenses to view the world

- “The function of the mappae mundi was primarily to provide a visual narrative of Christian history cast in a geographical framework, not to communicate geographical or cosmological facts”
