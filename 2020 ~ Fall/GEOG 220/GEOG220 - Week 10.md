# GEOG220 - Week 10: Geography of Language

> Language ~ a means of communicating ideas or feelings by means of a conventionalized system of signs, gestures, marks or articulate vocal  sounds

- Geography of language will be divided into 3 topics:
	1. The geography of world languages
	2. Dialects
	3. Language and regional identity

# 1. The Geography of World Languages
- Development of language is an outcome of:
	1. **Innovation** (Often involving lots of **isolation** and **time**)
	2. **Diffusion**; spread from one place to another

- **The Family Tree of Language**

## Indo-European
> One of the first real contributions to the geography of language was made by Sir William Jones, an employee of the British East India Company, who in 1786 observed the similarities between Sanskrit (an ancient East Indian language now only used for religious purposes) and a large number of European languages. He also noticed how dissimilar Indo-European languages were from those that were not Indo-European (i.e Japanese)

- **William Jones (1746-1794)**
	- Discovered that European languages shared similarities and were developed out of **Sanskrit**; surprised scholars in Britain who couldn't believe their language was derived from what they saw as a "primitive language"

- **Indo-European includes almost all of the languages of Europe:**
		- **Not Indo-European:** Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian (all Uralic); and Basque (an **isolate**; a language with no known connection to any other)

### Origins of Indo-European
- Older view was that invading nomadic hordes brought it from the Russian steppes
- **A Newer view: Colin Renfrew, Archeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins (London 1987)**
	- Suggests one source of origins in Anatolia (Turkey), and that Indo-European was spread from the Middle East across Europe from about 10,000 years ago by sedentary farmers who were also responsible for the diffusion of agriculture across the continent (Indo-Europeans eventually out-bred the non-Indo-Europeans because they could feed more people through agriculture)

- How to figure out where proto-Indo-European **(PIE)** began using the environment?
	- Approach is to figure out what the environment was like ~10,000 years ago
	- Then see if the words for some of the plants and animals that were found then exist in PIE (Ex: "birch")

- According to Colin Renfrew, Indo-European diffuses from agriculture westwards

## The Austronesian Family
- Another language family like Indo-European that has spread far
- “Austronesian languages are spoken today as native languages over more than half of the globe’s span, from Madagascar to Easter Island”

# 2. Dialect
- **“Dialect”** = regional variations from standard language in terms of...
	- **Accent**
		- Ex: “creek” said differently in 3 USA cultural hearths (same pattern for spread of vernacular houses in the Eastern USA)
	- **Vocabulary**
		- Ex: pop vs. soda, different words for "silly" (daft, soft, silly, etc.)
	- **Grammar**
		- Ex: Different way of ordering numbers in telling time ("it is five-and-twenty-to twelve")

- Dialects will develop because of either...
	- Lengthy periods of **isolation** from other speakers of the same language
	- Or, through **migrations**

## Migration & Isolation
- When people move to a new land, there seems to be **two possibilities** regarding the changes that occur to their language:
	1. When people move, **their language escapes changes that occur at home**
		- We consider examples of French in Quebec
	2. When people move, **their language undergoes considerable change**
		- We consider example of English in Newfoundland

### French in Quebec
- 1789 French Revolution:
	- The Revolutionaries **standardize language in France**
		- Because it was felt that the many regional dialects across France made people from the regions somehow “unequal”; Parisian French becomes the standard
		- BUT for those who had left France before this date... **older forms of French were preserved**; their language escaped the change that occurred at home

### English in Newfoundland
- Newfoundland: settled from 17th century onwards by English speakers from western England and Ireland
	- Vocabulary: new words for new environment:
		- "Ballicatter”= new words for “ice”
		- “bedlammer” = immature seal
		- “penguin” = originally for the Great Auk [from “pen gwn” = Welsh for “white head”]
	- Grammar: “... how many times am I after telling you ...”
	- Pronunciation: a distinct Irish/west of England accent

### Pidgin and Creole
- As well as dividing–as dialect formation indicates –languages can, in certain circumstances, combine with other languages to produce hybrid forms, which themselves may eventually become new languages; Pidgin and Creole

- **Pidgin** = “A pidgin is a system of  communication which has grown up among people who do not share a common language, but who want to talk to each other, for trading or other reasons"
- **Creole** = “A creole is a pidgin language which has become the mother tongue of a community –a definition which emphasizes that pidgins and creoles are two stages in a distinct process of linguistic development”

# Language and Regional Identity
- Because language is spoken by people who occupy space and is an intrinsic part of culture, it is not surprising that language has always been an important characteristic of the cultural region
- Many groups speak with pride about their language and will strongly identify with it, using language as part of the means to establish ethnic, regional, and national differences

## Quebec: Some Issues
- **In Quebec:** concern about declining birth rate and **language shift** of immigrants (into English, not French) has fueled a “nationalist project” designed to support and increase the use of French
- **Language shift** = an indicator of the number of people who adopt a new language, usually measured by the difference between mother tongueand home language populations

## Canada's Indigenous Peoples
- Decline of Aboriginal languages:
	- A worldwide phenomena, and one especially acute here:
		- As of the 1996 Census of Canada, only 3 of the 50 Aboriginal languages still spoken can be considered secure
			- Cree (76,475)
			- Ojibway (22,625)
			- Inuktitut (26,840)
			- Of the rest, **at least 12 are in danger of extinction**

## Canada: Some Issues
ROC (Rest of Canada): Predominantly anglophone, but note:
	- **Changing pattern of immigration** means that the leading allophone languages spoken at home have **changed from Italian (in 1971) to Chinese (1996)**
	- Because immigration is largely an urban phenomenon, the effects of recent flows have impacted Canada’s cities:
		- With 44% of its population having a mother tongue other than English or French (according to 2006 Census), Toronto has the largest proportion of allophones in Canada (At 41%, Vancouver is similar but Montreal only 22% allophone)
