# GEOG272 - Week 10: Water Supply

# Contents of the Global Freshwater Supply
- Water on Earth: distribution and reply
- The Hydrological cycle: water in the atmosphere, at the surface
- Water budgets, resource analysis
- **Surface water resources:** snow & ice, rivers & lakes, wetlands
- **Groundwater resources:** aquifers & wells

# "Land and Water Hemispheres"
- Land-water **unevenly distributed** around the planet; **there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere, but more water in the Southern Hemisphere**
- Present volume of water was attained ~2 billion years ago

- Earth's hydrosphere is in a **"steady-state equilibrium"** in terms of quantity
	- **Gains** occur as pristine water not previously at the surface emerges from within the Earth's crust **("out-gassing")**
	- **Losses** occur when water dissociates into H and O and the H escapes Earth's gravity into space or breaks down to form new compounds with other elements

# Freshwater Supply
- **99%** of surface water is in the form of **ice & glaciers**
- Freshwater is not evenly distributed

## Green water & Blue Water
- **Green water** = water that is absorbed by soil and plants, then released back into the air through evaporation; not available for withdrawal
	- "Water collected and stored by landscapes"
- **Blue water** = water collected in rivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater; available for withdrawal before it reaches the ocean
	- "Water collected and stored by bodies of water"

# The Hydrological Cycle: Glossary
- In the atmosphere:
	- **Evaporation** = phase change from liquid water to water vapor
	- **Transpiration** = the drawing of water by plant roots from soil-moisture storage
	- **Evapotranspiration** = the merging of evaporation and transpiration water loss into one term
	- **Precipitation (P)** = rain, snow, sleet, and hail; the moisture supply
	- **Advection** = horizontal movement of water/air from one place to another

- At the surface:
	- **Interception** = a delay in the absorption of precipitation into Earth's surface caused by vegetation or other ground cover
	- **Infiltration** = water access to subsurface regions of soil-moisture storage through penetration of the soil surface
	- **Surface runoff** = surplus water that flows across the ground surface towards stream channels when soils are saturated or when the ground is impermeable

- In the oceans:
	- **Eustacy** = changes in sea level due to changes in the volume of water in the oceans; changes in volume can be due to melting of glaciers, icebergs, pack ice / the thermal expansion of ocean water as air temperature increases

## Measuring Supply
- Most precipitation occurs on the **West coast** and less on the East coast

- **Rain Gauge** = a standardized device that captures and measures rainfall ("precipitation input")
- **Lysimeter** = a measurement device that isolates a representative volume of soil, subsoil, and plant cover to allow measurement of the moisture moving through the sample area; used to measure potential evapotranspiration (PE)

## Water Budgets: Where does water go?
- Water budget is derived from measuring the **input of precipitation and its distribution** and the **outputs of evapotranspiration, and surface runoff**; also includes moisture stored in the soil-moisture zone
- Covers timeframe from minutes to years
- Surpluses and deficits occur (depending on water "deposits" and "withdrawals")
- Developed by geographer **Charles Thornthwaite** (1899-1963) to analyze irrigation and maximize water use for agriculture

# Potential Evapotranspiration (PE): Water Demand
- **Actual evapotranspiration (AE)** is an actual expenditure of water to the atmosphere
- **Potential evapotranspiration (PE)** is amount of water that would evaporate and transpire under optimum moisture conditions (when adequate precipitation and soil moisture are present)
	- PE **requires energy** for the evaporation process
	- **The Sun** is a major source of this energy; the amount of energy received accounts for some 80% of the variation in PE
	- **Wind** is the second most important factor influencing PE, enabling water molecules to be removed from the ground surface

## Air & Vapor Pressure
- **Air pressure** is created by the motion, size, and number of gas molecules present in the air
- **Vapor pressure** is a measure of the tendency of a material to change into the gaseous or vapor state, and it **increases with temperature**
	- As vapor pressure is dependent on temperature, when the liquid in a closed container is heated, more molecules escape the liquid phase and evaporate
	- The greater number of vapor molecules striking the container walls more frequently, results in an increase in **pressure**

- The rate of evapotranspiration is associated with the gradient of **vapor pressure** between the ground surface and the layer of atmosphere receiving the evaporated water
	- In the real world, differences in **air pressure** and the **pressure gradient** force are caused by the unequal heating of the Earth's surface when **insolation** concentrates at the equator

### Vapor Pressure cont.
- **Vapor pressure** = the process of evaporation in a closed container will proceed until there are as many molecules returning to the liquid as there are escaping
	- At this point the vapor is said to be saturated, and the pressure of that vapor is called the **saturated vapor pressure, or equilibrium**
	- The temperature at which the vapor pressure at the surface of a liquid becomes equal to the **pressure** exerted by the surroundings (atmospheric pressure) is called the **boiling point of the liquid**

## High, Low & Equilibrium
- **High VP:** a substance with a **high vapor pressure** at normal temperatures is often referred to as **volatile**
	- High VP = easy to evaporate/volatile; "it wants to leave"
- **Low VP:** the high surface tension of water (water "sticks" to itself, meaning it doesn't "want to" evaporate) means water has a **low vapor pressure**
	- Low VP = hard to evaporate/stable; "it wants to stay"
- The **equilibrium** vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). VP is constant when there is an equilibrium of water molecules moving between the liquid phase and the gaseous phase (in a closed container)

## North vs. South
- **Thornthwaite** created an indirect method of estimating PE for most mid-latitude locations using **mean air temperature** and **daylength** (a function of latitude). Works for large-scale regional applications
- Higher PE values in the South, with **highest readings in the Southwest**, where higher average air temperature and lower RH exist (thus, greater demand for moisture). **Lower PE values are found at higher latitudes and elevations** (which have lower average temperatures)

# Subsurface Water: Glossary
- Below the surface (subsurface):
	- **Percolation** = the process by which water permeates the soil or porous rock into the subsurface environment
	- **Soil-moisture zone** = the area of water stored in soil between the ground surface and the water table. Water in this zone may be available or unavailable to plant roots, depending on soil texture characteristics
	- **Saturation** = state of soil that is holding all the water it can hold before runoff or further percolation occurs
	- **Base flow** = the portion of stream flow that consists of groundwater
	- **Soil-moisture utilization** = the extraction of soil-moisture by plants for their needs; efficiency of withdrawal decreases as the soil-moisture storage is reduced 
	- **Soil-moisture recharge** = water entering available soil storage spaces
	- **Permeability** = the ability for water to flow through soil or rock; a function of the texture and structure of the medium

## Types & Availability of Soil Water
- **Hygroscopic water** = that portion of soil moisture that is so tightly bound to each soil particle that it is unavailable to plant roots; the water, along with some bound capillary water, this is left in the soil after the wilting point is reached
- **Wilting point** = point in the soil-moisture balance when only hygroscopic water and some bound capillary water remain. Plants wilt and eventually die after prolonged stress from a lack of available water!
- **Capillary water** = soil moisture, most of which is available to plant roots; held in soil by the water's surface tension and cohesive forces between water and soil
- **Field capacity** = water held in the soil H-bonding against the pull of gravity, remaining after water drains from the larger pore spaces; the available water for plants
- **Gravitational water** = portion of surplus water that percolates downward from the capillary zone, pulled by gravity to the groundwater zone

## Soil
- **Soil** = the uppermost layer of the land surface that plants use and depend on for nutrients, water, and physical support

- Highly variable in nature; comes in many forms and is characterized according to several properties:
	- Texture
	- Color
	- Size
	- Temperature
	- Structure
	- Porosity
	- Chemistry, pH
	- Parent material
	- Organic material

- Different types of soil are found in different regions globally
	- **Mollisols** are found in Europe and North America
	- **Aridisols** are found in central America and Northern Africa
	- **Oxisols** are found in South America and Southern Africa

- Darker soil = more organic soil
- Red soil = iron-rich soil

- **Soil horizons** = layers of soil that differ in physical and chemical composition, organic content, or structure
	- **Organic horizons** = topsoil
	- **Mineral horizons** = mineral rich lower soil, little organic content
	- **Parent material** = original rock at lowest point of soil
- **Soil structure (from largest components to smallest)** = gravel > sand > silt > clay > colloids

# Other Forms of Water Supply: Surface Runoff

## Snow & Ice
- Largest amount of surface freshwater on Earth is stored in glaciers, permafrost, and polar ice
- Seasonal melting from glaciers/snowpack in temperate regions feeds streamflow; however, accelerated relates to glacial melting associated with today's climate change (global warming)
	- Climate changes will affect high-elevation water supplies (especially during dry season) before lower-elevation populations
- Estimates are that most glaciers will be gone by 2035 at present rates

## Rivers & Streams
- **Surface runoff + base flow** = rivers & streams that drains into lakes, wetlands, oceans, etc.
- **Fluvial systems** = networks of tributaries forming systems, with rivers being the main "trunk" and streams as secondary channels, varying in size and strength
- **Hydraulic processes** = erosive/abrasive work on channel banks as a result of moving water **(velocity)** transporting **sediment** downstream

## Watersheds
- **Watersheds** are defined by the geography of these drainage patterns; from ridge to ridge to the bottom of the drainage (e.g. a lake or a wetland)
- Watersheds can be located by looking at the ridge line of parallel mountain ranges where water will flow into a valley and naturally collect at the bottom due to high elevation on either side forming a watershed

- **Watershed details:**
	- Divide: usually the ridges/tops of mountains
	- Headwaters: snowmelt or precipitation runoff
	- Floodplains: flat areas seasonally inundated with water
	- Channel: course of a river or tributary that changes over time (dynamic equilibrium)

## Wetlands
- Naturally low-lying areas that are **permanently or seasonally saturated with fresh or salt water**
	- Low elevation means runoff naturally pools in these areas and causes the surplus of water
- Feature vegetation adapted to gleysolic soils (anaerobic)
- Environmental services include natural filtration, flood control, provision of habitats to a wide variety of plants and wildlife
- Includes marshes, swamps, bogs, peatbogs

## Lakes
- Lakes are fed by precipitation, streamflow, and groundwater; ~50% of the world's freshwater is stored in **7 major freshwater lakes**

## Aquifers Vocabulary
- **Zone of aeration** = some soil pore spaces may contain air
- **Zone of saturation** = water fills the spaces between particles of sand, gravel, and rock
- **Slope & flow** = towards lower elevations
- **Unconfined aquifer** = layer has a permeable layer above, impermeable layer below
- **Wells in an unconfined aquifer** = not under pressure and must be pumped to the surface
- **Dry wells & aquifer overuse** = (see demand)
- **Aquicludes & springs** = springs form where the perched water table intersects the surface
- **Water table at surface** = where water table intersects the surface
- **Confined** = bounded above and below by impermeable layers (aquilude)
- **Potentiometric surface** = the level to which groundwater under pressure can rise on its own, and can be above ground level
- **Artesian wells** = groundwater in a sloping, confined aquifer where water is under pressure. if the top of a well is lower than the pot. surface, artesian water may rise in the well and flow at the surface without pumping
