# GEOG272 - Week 11: Water Demand

# Global Diversion and Withdrawal of Freshwater Resources
- We put water where we want it, for various purposes:
	1. Increase supplies for a community/region
	2. Increase supplies for agriculture
	3. To deflect watercourses away from areas to be protected
	4. To drain land for development
	5. Enhance the capacity of a river
	6. To combine water flows from several sources into one channel, especially to generate electricity (hydro)

- Vast majority of freshwater resources is coming from **aquifers** that store sub-surface groundwater are are accessible by humans

# Water Withdrawal
- We take water away from the earth
- Water is taken for **domestic, agricultural, or industrial sectors**
	- 80% of Canada's freshwater is used for **industry** (mining)
	- In the Southern Hemisphere and Asia most freshwater goes to agriculture
	- Oceania has the highest domestic water use due to high temperatures and the population being spread out among islands with no way to get water; domestically dependent on freshwater
	- Overall on average most freshwater is used for agriculture (71%)

## North America
- Uses 13%-17% of total renewable freshwater resources
- Canadians and US citizens consume around twice as much water per person as the average industrialized world, though pay far less; use greater relative to developing world

- Unsustainable use of Midwestern aquifers
- Water exports and diversions

- Water demand in the US is concentrated to California and the Midwest (due to California farming)
	- Much of the water is diverted to California and thus doesn't reach Mexico, meaning Mexican farmers are receiving very salinated water

# Case Study: The Shrinking Ogallala Aquifer
- Shrinking aquifer that supplies much of the Midwest with its freshwater
- "The High Planes aquifer underlies about 112 million acres in parts of 8 states: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming"
- Water levels declined in parts of the High Plains aquifer due to the **onset of substantial irrigation with groundwater (around 1950)**

- The **saturated thickness** of the aquifer is the distance from the water table to the base of the aquifer

# The Aral Sea
- The Aral Sea used to be the fourth largest lake
- The lake is salt water but is fed by fresh water rivers
- In the 1950's the Soviet Union began using the rivers to irrigate the surrounding agricultural area, a process that is continued to this day by Uzbekistan
- "The exposure of the bottom of the lake has **released salts and pesticides into the atmosphere** poising both farm land and people alike"; carcinogenic dust is blown into villages **causing throat cancers and respiratory diseases**

# Research Study into Irrigation techniques in Uzbekistan (Drip vs. Furrow Irrigation)
- Main goal of the research was to measure cotton water use, and to determine irrigation water scheduling parameters associated with optimal seed-lint yield and irrigation water use efficiency
- To investigate irrigation scheduling, the **field capacity (FC)** index was adopted. Irrigations were scheduled when soil water in the root zone was depleted to specific fractions of FC
- Results: under **drip irrigation**, more water was saved from evaporation in comparison to **furrow irrigation**
	- **Drip** = providing a water drip directly to the crops needed to grow, only providing water when the soil become adequately de-saturated; **less evaporation = more efficient**
	- **Furrow** = flooding a ditch with water to saturate the soil of crops grown in that ditch; **more evaporation = less efficient**

# "Megaprojects"
- James Bay Hydroelectric Project in Quebec
	- Produces electricity from five sources flowing in a 350,000 km2 area of QC (the size of France!)
	- Creates jobs, attracts industrial growth, stability
	- However, also homeland for about 10,000 Cree and Inuit whose lives will be impacted

## Damming a River: The Pros and Cons
- **Pros:**
	- Irrigation drinking water
	- Generation of electricity
	- New recreational opportunities
	- Flood control

- **Cons:**
	- Population displacement
	- Sediment capture
	- Risk of failure and catastrophic flooding
	- Habitat alteration (upstream and downstream)
	- Lost recreational opportunities
	- Declining fisheries
	- Reduced downstream flow and disruption of flooding

## China's Three-Gorges Dam
- Dam project on the Yangtse River
- 5 times the size of Hoover Dam; 200 meters high, 2 km long
- Reservoir going back more than 370 miles up the Yangtze River

- **Pros:**
	- Deeper water will accommodate transport and expanded trade
	- Will add 10% to China's energy supplies
	- Many jobs associated with construction and operation

- **Cons:**
	- Ecological and humanitarian nightmare
	- Most expensive hydroelectric project in history (by 2008); $30-70 billion, $58 million embezzled (funds for displaced villagers)
	- Flood hundreds of towns and villages
	- Drown ancient archaeological treasures
	- Displace 1.2 to 1.9 million people, to be resettled in far less farming-friendly locations
	- Bigger cities and towns forced to absorb the migrants face economic and social upheaval

- **Possible consequences:**
	- Unintended health consequences as billions of tons of industrial wastewater and sewage from cities along the Yangtze contaminate the reservoir
	- Trapped silt behind the dam, depriving downstream areas of fertile soil
	- Lessening overflow of the river, changing relationship with tides
	- Disruption of wildlife habitats, blockages of nutrient flows
	- Region has several major fault lines

## The High Aswan Dam, Egypt
- Built in 1971, costing $1.5 billion

- **Upstream:**
	- Loses about 10% of Nile flow to evaporation/yr
	- Seepage around edges
	- Accumulation of silt in reservoir some 200 km upstream
	- In general around large dams, eutrophication/spread of water-borne diseases
- **Downstream:**
	- Fields Afflicted with increased salt and waterlogging
	- No silt being delivered downstream
	- Replacing silt with chemical fertilizers, creating a "silt"-famine downstream
	- Without silt, banks eroding; sardines gone, Nile not flushed, so loaded with fertilizers, sewage, industrial waste, etc.

- **Point sources of pollution:** 
	- **Urban waste** water treatment facilities: old and in need of expensive maintenance or replacement; ~5.4 billion per year to modernize and upgrade all existing facilities
	- **Industrial** release of chemicals directly into waterways, especially ammonia and nitrogen, +300 other substances in **mining and production related sectors**

# Non-point or "Diffuse" Sources
- **Agriculture:** crop and livestock production

- Diffuse pollution represents a 'layered' problem:
	1. Concern of environment degradation and the economic costs imposed on downstream users
	2. Link between diffuse pollution and negative impacts on ecosystem health, and human health 
	3. Touching on human values, beliefs, and behaviors; some feel more emphasis should be placed here to tackle the diffusion problem

## The Spread of Contaminants
- Jet fuel spilled years ago can be pumped out and burned in a lighter
- An array of 10,000 test wells used to sample groundwater beneath the Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod.

## Mercury: "A Classic Global Pollutant"
- Toxic metal that evaporates in warm temperatures, and condenses as temperatures drop
- Highly persistent
- Moves slowly through the oceans and atmosphere, to be re-emitted on land
- The Arctic is a "sink" for mercury

- **Mercury Deposition Network**
	- Tracks atmospheric transport and deposition: the dominant pathway delivering mercury to many of the world's lakes and oceans

- **The Bioaccumulation of Methylmercury** = the exponential accumulation of mercury up the food chain from smaller to larger organisms; the reason tuna, a large fish, has a lot of mercury

## Local Dependence on Gold Mining
- In Victoria Lake are (NW Tanzania) gold mining is performed by hand
- It is estimated that more than 350,000 people in Tanzania are dependent on the income from gold mining
- About 20 tons of mercury is annually released to the environment within the country, throughout the region

# Delivery Systems & Demand: Aquifer Overdraft, Overland Evaporation
- Groundwater overdrafts in Arizona cause hundreds of fissures; in 1980 the state began to regulate groundwater withdrawals
- The **Central Arizona Project** aqueduct brings Colorado River water to farms and cities

# Explosive Urbanization = The Continent's Most Endangered River in 1993
- "Separated by a gulf of economics and the shriveled current of the Rio Grande, a squatter community in Juarez, Mexico, overlooks the glimmering downtown of El Paso"
- Before Mexico, it absorbs untreated sewage, pesticides, and industrial waste; "the dregs of a bruising border boom."

# Freshwater Invasive Species
- (picture) Blasting zebra muscles from a power plant intake on lake Erie
	- "One job can fill 12 dump trucks"
	- Represents one of hundreds of examples

# Virtual Water / Desalination Technology
- **Proxy trade** remedy: ship "virtual water"
	- "Virtual water is the amount of water that is used to create the product, and is thus essentially embedded in the item"
- **Supply-side** solution: desalination technology

# Potable Water in Developed Countries
- Standing water vs flowing water
- Displaced populations
- Potable water supplies
- Sanitation
- Education

- Water-borne diseases in the Third World
	- Cholera
	- Enabled by market flooding and standing waters in public areas
	
## The Project in Beira used both Environmental Health Engineering and Education
- **Environmental Health Engineering:**
	- Domestic water supplies (wells, water storage tanks)
	- Drainage
	- Training of municipal workers
	- Sanitation (latrines)

- **Environmental Education:**
	- Survey of households and wells
	- IEC programs

- **Environmental health engineering + environmental health education = improvement of the health of the community**
