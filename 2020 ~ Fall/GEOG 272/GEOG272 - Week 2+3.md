# GEOG272 - Week 2+3: The Earth's Modern Atmosphere
> Atmosphere = surrounding environment or influence; "Atmos" = Greek for vapor/air

- A **thin** blanket of a mixture of gases surrounding the planet, **held close to the Earth's surface by gravity**

# Earth's Atmosphere Summarized: Evolution, Composition, Structure, Function
- **Evolution:** the atmosphere is dynamic and continually evolving
- **Composition:** major fixed and variable gases, aerosols
- **Structure & temperature:** troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere
- **Functional layers:** homosphere, heterosphere, ionosphere, ozone layer, greenhouse layer

# Evolution of Earth's Atmosphere
- Today is possible the 4th general atmosphere in Earth's history

- **4 billion years ago:**
	- **Atmosphere was deadly to all life but algae and bacteria**
	- Primordial atmosphere of **hydrogen**, with some **helium** and traces of ammonia and methane, eventually leaks off into space (allowing for a less deadly atmosphere to develop)
		- These gases are extremely light and try to float off into space rather than sinking down into the earth gravity
	- Later, release **(outgassing)** of carbon dioxide, sulphuric gases, nitrogen, and water vapor trapped within Earth's interior
		- **Today we still experience this process through on-going volcanic activity**

- **2.2 billion years ago:**
	- Early ocean life evolved, bacteria began process of **photosynthesis**, finally **converting carbon dioxide to oxygen**, which became "significant", but unstable in the atmosphere. Atmosphere was still high in sulfuric gases, low in nitrogen
	- As a result there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, **leading to cooler temperatures worldwide** (slight change in temperature can have a large effect)
	- As the Earth cooled, **vapor condensed to form clouds and rain**. Oceans formed and grew, nitrogen increased; **still no stable supply of oxygen**
	- Cooling > condensation > somewhat acidic conditions

- **600 million years ago:**
	- Oxygen levels further increasing
		- As oxygen increased, carbon dioxide decreased; oxygen molecules absorbed sunlight forming the ozone, **shielding subsequent life on the planet from UV radiation**

- **540 million years ago:**
	- **Carbonate skeleton-building organisms** begin to absorb carbon dioxide from sea water

- **300 million years ago:**
	- Emergence of **shell-forming plankton** (planktonic calcifers)
	- Ocean levels fell, exposing continental shelves

## A New Atmosphere
- Free-floating organisms in the oceans **cycled carbon through their bodies, into ocean sediments**, causing oceans to draw greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere resulting in a more moderate physical atmosphere
- Growth and death of **terrestrial forests**:
	- Forests absorb more sunlight, producing more water vapor = influence capacity to regulate atmospheric temperature = decomposition = **coal/oil ("Carboniferous period")**
- **The carbon cycle:** The extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis allowed carbon to be deposited into the Earth, leading to coal and oil reserves; later returned to the atmosphere through natural fires completing the cycle
- All this contributed to a changing atmosphere eventually dominated by **nitrogen (from the geosphere)** & **oxygen (from the biosphere)**

# Gas
- **Relevant vocabulary:**
	- **Atom** = basic unit of a chemical element
	- **Molecule** = group of atoms bonded together
	- **Gas** = a "cloud" of individual atoms with **very weak attractive forces**, compared to a liquid or solid (outer shells are completely filled with electrons)
	- **Inert gas** = a gas that is **relatively** non-reactive with other substances a due to **few** open electron slots; **(inert = non-reactive)**
	- **Noble gas** = a gas that is **completely** non-reactive with other substances due to no open electron slots **(noble = completely non-reactive)**

## The Physics of a Gas
- Heating a has causes it to occupy a greater volume, with particles vibrating more rapidly, spreading over more space
- If in a container, gas exerts increased pressure against the walls, where pressure exerted by a gas is the sum total of the impact of the particles composing it
- **^Temperature = ^Vibration = ^# of force impacts**

> Kinetic Energy ~ The energy of motion, the vibrational energy we measure as temperature

> Temperature ~ The measure of the average kinetic energy of individual molecules in matter

> Heat ~ The flow of kinetic energy from one body to another, resulting in a temperature difference between them; depends upon density or mass of substance/body

### "Mean Free Path" of a Gas Molecule
> Mean Free Path ~ The distance a particle must travel before a collision with another particle (molecules collide and change direction)

- A cmÂ³ of air consists of some 30 x 10^15 molecules (of gases)
- The average speed of a nitrogen (N2) molecule is about 500 m/second
- Each molecules goes on the average 5.9 x 10^-5 m until it approaches another molecules and is repelled by it; **all molecules travel a certain average distance before they inevitably come into contact with another**, this distance of unobstructed runway for each molecule is called the **" mean free path"**

- **Variables in mean free path calculations:**
	- Viscosity, density, pressure of air, size of molecule

- Heat is **created** when kinetic energy is transferred between molecules (between bodies)

- **Altitude and mean free path:** (altitude = mean free path; distance before hitting another molecule)
	- 300 km = 20 km mean free path
	- 250 km = 1 km
	- 150 km = 10 m
	- 100 km = 16 km
	- Sea level = 0.1 micrometers

# Composition of Air
- Gases in the atmosphere are either **Fixed or variable**
	- **Fixed gases** = gases that are fixed (relatively) in amount around the planet
		- Ex: Nitrogen & Oxygen
	-  **Variable gases** - gases that vary in amount from place to place and are not uniform over the whole Earth
		- Ex: Water vapor, ozone
		- **Today**, carbon dioxide may also be considered a **variable gas** (usually measured in parts per million) due to its variable growth over time; **no longer constant**

- In the early atmosphere, **elemental contributors included:**
	- Hydrogen, helium, ammonia, methane, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
- Later (after the outgassing of elements from the early atmosphere), **fixed gases nitrogen & oxygen** predominated, along with smaller amounts of other elements
	- **Water vapor** is an important contributor, but considered a **variable gas** due to its many forms and locations around the planet, depending upon latitude and presence of water bodies

## Atmospheric Gases by %
- **Nitrogen:** 78.1%
- **Oxygen:** 20.9%
- **Argon:** 0.9%
- **Other:** remaining 0.1%

- Earth is a **nitrogen dominated atmosphere**

# Functional Spheres: Homosphere & Heterosphere
![](https://images.slideplayer.com/1/230655/slides/slide_6.jpg "Homosphere & Heterosphere")

- Note the **temperature profile**; see how the temperature within the layers either rises or falls with an increase in altitude (troposphere gets **colder as altitude climbs** while the stratosphere gets **warmer as the altitude climbs**) 

- Component gases are **layered**
	- Diffuse boundaries between layers
	- **Turbopause** = boundary/edge of a layer
- **Turbulence mixes component gases** = more homogeneous
- Component gases are spatially uniform (fixed gases) with the exception of **water vapor and ozone** (variable gases)

- **Heterosphere layers:**
	- Exosphere ("outer sphere")
	- Heterosphere ("changing sphere")
	- Thermosphere ("heat sphere")
	- Ionosphere/Magnetosphere

- **Homosphere layers:**
	- Homosphere ("same sphere")
	- Mesosphere ("middle sphere")
	- Stratosphere ("stratified sphere")
	- Ozonosphere ("ozone layer")
	- Troposphere ("turning/mixing sphere")

> (Zone)pause = upper boundary of that particular zone before entering the next; Ex: Mesopause of the mesosphere before entering the thermosphere, thermopause of the thermosphere before entering space

## Thermosphere: 80-480 km
- **Thermopause** = upper boundary of thermosphere before entering space **(edge of atmosphere)**

- "Heat sphere", where temperature rises sharply with altitude; heat output however is minimally due to such **low pressure/density of molecules**
- Absorption of gamma rays, X-rays, and shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation

## Mesosphere: 50-80 km
- **Mesopause** = upper boundary of mesosphere before entering the thermosphere

- Averages -90 degrees
	- **lower air temperature with higher altitude**
- Low pressure/density of molecules due to altitude
- **Noctilucnent clouds (NLCs)** in upper mesosphere = cosmic or meteoric dust particles, acting as a nuclei around which ice crystals form

## Stratosphere: 18-50 km
- **Stratopause** = upper boundary of stratosphere before entering mesosphere

- Higher air temperature with higher altitude, from -57 degrees at 18 km to about 0 degrees at stratopause
- ~19.9% of total mass of atmosphere
- Utilized by aircrafts to take advantage of strong persistent winds
- Little mixing occurring with troposphere due to **tropospheric "lid"**
- As greenhouse gases increase in the troposphere, **the stratosphere cools**
- Contains the **ozone layer**

# The Ozone Layer (Ozonosphere)
- A naturally-occurring layer in the **upper stratosphere**
- **Absorbs ~99% of incoming UV**
- In **dynamic equilibrium** before 1930
- Concentration of atmospheric ozone is indicated in **Dobson units**

## Formation of Ozone
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/711x323/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/startswithabang/files/2018/01/make_ozone.jpg?width=960 "Ozone Production")

> Photodissociation ~ Breakdown of compounds due to exposure to UV light (insolation), releasing the previously binded components

- **Photodissociation** = Breakdown of oxygen molecules due to **insolation**; leads to **creation of oxygen atoms**
	- Oxygen atoms created during this process later **recombine with other oxygen molecules to create ozone**

## Breakdown of Ozone
- Human-produced compounds are broken down by UV radiation in the stratosphere, they then seek molecular balance by **"stealing" an oxygen atom from an ozone molecule** (destroying the ozone molecule)
	- Ex: Nitrogen will create nitrogen oxide, chlorine will create chlorine oxide
- Thus the ozone is destroyed by reactions with **chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen gases**

- **Important compounds that contribute to this process:**
	- Methane
	- Chlorofluorocarbons
	- Nitrous oxide

## Polar Stratospheric Clouds
- Ozone-depleted substances are transported great distances by atmospheric air motions
- The severe depletion of the **Antarctic** ozone layer known as the **"ozone hole"** occurs because of the special atmospheric and chemical condition that exist there
- The very low winter temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere cause **polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)** to form
- Special reactions that occur on PSCs, combined with the relative isolation of polar stratospheric air, allow chlorine and bromine reactions to produce the ozone hole in Antarctic springtime

# Catalytic Reactions / Social Reactions
> Catalytic Reaction Cycle ~ Chain of chemical reactions which result in the destruction of many ozone molecules **while the molecule that started the reaction is reformed to continue the process**; cyclical

- Because of catalytic reactions, **an individual chlorine atom on average destroys nearly a thousand ozone molecules before it is converted into a form that is harmless to ozone**
- Aerosols and clouds can **accelerate ozone loss** through reactions on cloud surfaces

# Ionosphere: 50-1000 km
- Absorbs cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, and UV-C -> removal of electrons from atoms and molecules, which become positively charged (electrons are negatively charged) = **ionization**
- 3 subregions: F, E, and D
- Influences radio broadcasts and satellite communication

> Blue jets & Red Sprites ~ Electrical discharges above active thunderstorms in the ionosphere

- Radio waves can be **bounced** off the ionosphere to send them large distances

# Magnetosphere
- The **region of space that surrounds the Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth** (rather than the magnetic field of space)
- The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field

# Spectrum of Shortwave Energy
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1095/2016/11/03155014/OSC_Astro_05_02_Radiation2.jpg "Wavelength Spectrum")

- Some wavelengths are absorbed or reflected within various levels in the atmosphere

# Troposphere: 0-18 km
- **"Tropo"** = ancient Greek for "turn", "turn toward", "change"; often associated with weather
- **Where practically all weather phenomena occurs**
- Contains **~80% of all atmospheric gases**
	- Bottom third (4 km) **contains half of all gases in the atmosphere**, and is the **only breathable layer**

- Temperature gradient is **"upside down"** (warmest part at the bottom)
	- moving upwards the temperature cools by 6.5 degrees Celsius/vertical km traveled = **lapse rate**

> Lapse Rate ~ Rate of temperature decrease with altitude

## Weather & Water Vapor
- **Mixing** accounts for why the warmer air rises to the top (as opposed to solar energy being responsible for this)
- **Most water vapor is found in the troposphere**, but varies with altitude and latitude (the higher the altitude and latitude, the lower the water vapor content)

## The Tropopause
- **Tropopause** = upper boundary of troposphere before entering stratosphere

- Acts as a **"lid"**, keeping cooler air from mixing with warmer air in stratosphere
	- This "lid" is what stops clouds from rising into stratosphere, they rise to the top of troposphere and disperse as they reach the tropopause
- Average temperature of **-57 degrees Celsius** at tropopause
- ~18 km @ equator, 12 km @ mid-latitude, 8 km over the poles

# Atmospheric Pressure
- **Weight of atmosphere = atmospheric pressure**
	- The lower you are in the atmosphere the greater amount of atmosphere that rests above you, and therefor greater pressure; **lower = higher pressure**
	- Imagine all of Earth's atmosphere as a tank of water, the deeper in the water you go the more water that is above you weighing you down, thus creating a greater pressure

- **Sea-level atmospheric pressure = 1013.2 mb (millibars)**

- **Higher altitude = lower atmospheric density, mass of atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure**

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8855e520056a5b92c4bbc649c4ce9f9e "Atmospheric Pressure Chart")

- Compression of the Atmosphere is due to **Gravity**; causes the compression of air molecules in the atmosphere

# History of Atmospheric Science
- **Temperature: 1590's-1840's**
	- In 1593, **Galileo** invented an early version of a **thermometer** (a thermoscope); those with liquid-in-glass and calibrated scales became available in the early 1700's by **Daniel Fahrenheit** and around 1740 by **Anders Celsius**
	- In 1848, **William Thomson (aka Lord Kelvin)** developed an "absolute" temperature scale, absolute being when molecules of a gas stop moving and have zero volume (-273ËC)

- **Atmospheric pressure: 1640's**
	- In 1643, **Evangelista Torricelli** invented the **barometer**, a device to measure the weight of the atmosphere (a column of air) at sea-level; atmospheric pressure at sea level is **1013.25 millibars**, one standard atmosphere
	- Around 1647, **Blaise Pascal** then used the barometer to show that **pressure decreases with altitude**
	- The combined use of the barometer and thermometer then allowed the vertical structure of the atmosphere to be investigated

- **"Ideal gas law": mid 1600's**
	- In 1660, **Robert Boyle** studied the compressibility of air, stating that **air volume is inversely proportional to its pressure**; later in 1802 **J.A.C. Charles** showed that **air volume is also directly proportional to its temperature**
	- Combining the two created **"the ideal gas law"**, relating pressure, volume, and temperature as **PV = nRT**; this "ideal" is a hypothetical gas that follows certain rules and forms a baseline allowing us to model and predict the behavior or real gases; **"One of the most important relationships in atmospheric science"**

- **Gases in the atmosphere: mid-late 1800's**
	- By the end of the 1800's, 4 main "constituents" of the atmosphere were determined: **nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide
	- In 1824, **Joseph Fourier** identified the **"greenhouse effect"** occurring in the Earth's lower atmosphere

# Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Energy Emitted from a Surface
- Also known as **"blackbody radiation"**
- The total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature
- Derived independently by Josef Stefan (1879) and Ludwig Boltzmann (1884) from different perspectives

- **Emissivity** = ratio of energy emitted by a ârealâ surface to that emitted by a âblackbodyâ at same temperature and wavelength
	- **Emissivity is equal to absorptivity, and incoming energy is either reflected or absorbed â so emissivity is zero for a perfectly reflective body, one for a perfect black body, and in between zero and one for all other bodies**

# Air Pollution
- Also understood as **variable atmospheric components**
- **Air pollution** = contamination of the air with dust, fumes, gas, mist, odor, smoke, or vapor: an old problem throughout the history of civilization
- Has both natural and anthropocentric (human) components

## Natural Factors Affecting Air Pollution
- **Winds** allow for the **movement of dust** (particles under 62 microns) in the atmosphere; there are billions of tons of dust in the atmosphere at any one time
	- Causes the transport of pollution from one region to another

- **Local and regional landscapes:**
	- Mountains and hills form barriers to air movement that direct pollutants from one area to another, trapping and concentrating air pollution
	- **Arctic Haze** = concentration of particles and air pollution that diminishes **air clarity**, noticed in the Arctic due to lower latitude and North American industry (Increases in wildfires also add to the haze); there doesn't seem to be an Antarctic haze

- **Volcanoes** are a key natural source for air pollution; thousands of metric tons of sulfur dioxide can be produced each day of volcanic activity

## Wildfires
- Wildfire smoke can linger in the atmosphere for up to months depending on how long the fires burned
	- One reason itâs able to do that is because the superheated smoke and ash rising into the air can trigger **pyrocumulonimbus** events, or **fire-induced thunderstorms**; these storms allow smoke particles to stay in the stratosphere for weeks due to it forming a **very stable layer**, allowing wildfire smoke to travel huge distances across the globe

- **Smoke particles in the atmosphere can cool the Earth, however only slightly** and in climate-sensitive areas can cause a **regional warming effect**

## SMOG: Smoke + Fog
- Coined in early 1900's to describe fog and smoke containing sulfuric acids, but today really **describes the great quantities of car exhaust in major urban settings resulting in hazy sky, and reduced, scattered sunlight**
- Industrial smog pollution is attributed to **coal-burning industries**

## Agricultural Spray Drift
- **"Drift"** = the airborne movement of agricultural chemicals as particles of vapor ouside of the intended agricultural target area
- **Factors include:** formulation and volatility of chemicals applied, nozzle type, sprayer pressure, and weather conditions, with higher temperatures increasing probability of vapor drift

- **Drift distances:**
	- Coarser droplets move short distances and fall close to the point of release
	- Finer particles (i.e. less than 200 microns) can remain suspended on air currents for long periods of time and can be carried far outside of the target area.

- Due to the distance of drift, it is considered a **local**, rather than regional, atmospheric threat

## Temperature Inversions
- Vertical temperature and atmospheric density can **worsen pollution episodes**
- Inversion occurs when the typical temperature decrease with altitude reverses this trend and begins to increase at some higher point; can occur at any elevation
- **Warm-air inversion sandwich** = cooler polluted air is trapped beneath a layer of warm air (inversion layer), in turn trapped beneath cooler air

## Air Quality Health Index
- **The AQHI communicates four primary things:**
	1. It measures the air quality in relation to your health on a scale from 1 to 10. The higher the number, the greater the health risk associated with the air quality. When the amount of air pollution is very high, the number will be reported as 10+.
	2. A category that describes the level of health risk associated with the index reading (e.g. Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Health Risk).
	3. Health messages customized to each category for both the general population and the âat riskâ population.
	4. Current hourly AQHI readings and maximum forecast values for today, tonight and tomorrow.â

- The AQHI is calculated based on the relative risks of a combination of common air pollutants that is known to harm human health; These pollutants are:
	- **Ozone** (O3) at ground level
	- **Particulate Matter** (PM2.5/PM10)
	- **Nitrogen Dioxide** (NO2)

### Particulate Matter
- Diverse mixture of fine particles such as haze, smoke, dust; smaller particles are aerosols

- **PM2.5** = particles that are **2.5 microns or less** in diameter, can get into lungs and bloodstream (combustion particles, organics, and metallic aerosols)
- **PM10** = particles that are **10 microns or less**, are courser and less hazardous except for individuals with asthma
- **PM0.1** particles are now being discovered, ultra-fine and much more dangerous than other particles

- Asthma cases have nearly **doubled** since 1980 in the USA

# Atmospheric Aerosols
- Microscopic particles suspended in the atmosphere, concentrated in lower homosphere
- Spatially variable
- **Dark colored = warming, light colored = cooling**
- Enhance cloud formation
- Coming from both natural and anthropocentric sources
- **Residence time in lower 2 km of troposphere is ~5-9 days; ~1 month in upper troposphere; ~2-3 years in stratosphere**

# Acid Deposition
- **Acid deposition** = Acid rain, acid snow, or acid in a dry form (dust, aerosols)
- Winds carry acid-producing chemicals that are eventually deposited on landscapes or water bodies
- Linked to declining fish populations, fish kills in NE U.S., SE Canada, Sweden, Norway + extensive forest damage in Germany;
- Damage to buildings in many industrial countries
- Acid rain linked leaching of calcium, aluminum and magnesium cations from clay minerals in the soil; nutrient losses and increased pH are harmful to fish and plant communities

- Wind and weather patterns are international, so efforts to curb acid deposition become complex, as reductions in emissions are tied to energy conservation, thus becoming social decisions as well as environmental decisions

## Methylmercury
- Increased acidity also converts natural-occurring mercury into **methylmercury** that is deadly to aquatic life.
- Mercury atoms bond with carbon and **move through biological systems** as an organometallic compound
- Damage includes rearrangement of soil nutrients, death of soil micro-organisms, and aluminum induced calcium deficiency

# The Carbon Cycle
![](https://microbiologyclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carbon-Cycle-Diagram-1024x848.jpg "Carbon Cycle")

- **Carbon** = an element that is crucial to the existence of life and has many important industrial applications
- Has the unique ability to **link with other carbon atoms** and especially **hydrogen and oxygen** (Ex: Carbon dioxide/CO2)

## Total Carbon Pool
- Total carbon pool = **~49,000 metric gigatons**

- **Ocean ecosystems:**
	- Oceans hold 71% of the world's carbon; dead organic matter and phytoplankton = 3%
- **Terrestrial ecosystems:**
	- Fossil carbon = 22%; forests = 3%; atmosphere = 1%

## Coal
**Coal is classified by its fixed carbon content:**
	- **Peat** = low fixed carbon content and a high moisture content.
	- **Lignite** = the lowest rank of coal.
	- **Bituminous** = more carbon and a correspondingly higher heating value
	- **Anthracite** = highest carbon content and heating value.

- **Whats in coal smoke?**
	- **Sulfur dioxide:** reacts with water in clouds to create **acid rain**
	- **Nitrogen oxides:** heat of power plant burners turns nitrogen into nitrogen oxides
	- **Mercury:** escapes from power plant exhaust
	- **Carbon dioxide:** Power plants today release all their CO2 into the atmosphere
	- **Particulates:** affects people who have breathing or heart problems
