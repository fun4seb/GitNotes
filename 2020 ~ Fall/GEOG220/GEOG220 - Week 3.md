# GEOG220 - Week 3: The Evolution of Human Geography Part 2
- **Previous course content summarized:**
	1. Almost all early people had an applied knowledge of geography
	2. Groups such as the Ancient Greeks were able to build on this knowledge with **(a) topographic description,** and **(b) mathematical or astronomic observation of their world**
	3. This knowledge gathered in Greece was abandoned during the "Dark Ages" (time following the collapse of the Roman Empire), and replaced by the **mappa mundi** (medieval world maps, also called "T-O maps")
		- These medieval maps were much less geographically accurate, however were in much more agreement with the Christian world view of western Europe in the Middle Ages

- The "T-O" Map:

# Progress During During Middle Ages
- While geographic knowledge generally **regresses** during the Middle Ages **("Dark Ages")** in Europe, the study was still alive and well in **two parts of the world:**
	1. **The Arab realm**
	2. **China**

## The Arab Realm
- Arab scholars built on geography with their advances in **math and astronomy** and the knowledge of the Ancient Greeks that they **preserved long after it was abandoned by Western Europe**

- **Key figures:**
	- **Al-Idrisi** (1100-1165)
		- Creates a **world map** for Roger II of Sicily (1097-1154)
			- Engraved on a silver disc ~6 feet wide for the palace in Palermo, Italy
			- Describes the creation in a work called **"The Book of Pleasant Journeys to Faraway Lands"**
		- Follower of **Ptolemy** but also gains information from Arab and Norman Knowledge
	
	- **Ibn Batuta** (1304-1368)
		- Visits China and Africa, probably the person who has **traveled the furthest around the world**

- **Key Work: "The Book of Curiosities" (1050)**
	- Recently discovered in **2000**

### "The Book of Curiosities" (1050)

- First maps to use a **scale** & **Itineraries**
- We see how Ptolemaic knowledge is added to by Arabic work

## China
- From **200 BC** to the **1500's**, **China was the most advanced geographically:**
	- Invention of the compass (first used in **Feng-Shui**)
	- **Zhu Siben's map of China**
- In addition to China's technical advancements, they are also notable for their great travelers
	- **Key Figure:** **Xuangzang**; traveled further than anyone (except Ibn Batuta!)

- China was certainly one of the most technologically advanced countries of the world during the Middle Ages, and it was the travels of people such as Marco Polo along the Silk Road that led to the unraveling of Europe’s medieval world map **(Mappamundi)** and its radical revision by **Christopher Columbus**

### Xuangzang's Travels: From China to India and Back (629 - 645 AD)
- Xuanzang was a **Chinese Buddhist monk** who had come to be very worried by the fact that the Buddhist texts available to him in China were of a **poor quality, missing pieces, and incorrectly translated**
- What was supposed to be the same text actually varied between monastery to monastery, this meant that somewhere there was an **original and correct copy of these texts**
- Xuanzang decided that a **trip to the source of the knowledge** was the only way to find out, his maps show the lengths he went to achieve this goal
- So we should see his travels as an example of **cultural diffusion** of religion and related artifacts

> Cultural Diffusion ~ T he spread of one culture's practices, beliefs, and/or items, like food, music, or tools from one group to another.

- **Xuangzang's travels in brief:**
	1. 629 AD Xuanzang **travels to India** along the northern edges of the Taklamakan Desert
	2. At **Balkh**, he learns of origins of Stupa design; morphs into the pagoda design in China & Japan
	3. **In the hearth of Buddhism (Nepal)**, Xuanzang learns Sanskrit, **obtains correct versions of texts** and visits many sacred sites (638-642 AD). His meeting with King Harsha leads to further missions from China, one of which seeks to learn of the secrets of **sugar processing**
	4. He travels **3,000 miles around India**, and accumulates **527 boxes of texts and statues** to bring back to China; He uses an elephant given by King Harsha to help carry his loot (the animal is later lost in a mountain gorge)
	5. 645 AD He returns along the southern route, the same one taken by Marco Polo in 1271
	6. **Crossing River Indus near here, loses all plant seeds and lot of texts on return to China**

# Marco Polo (1254-1324)
- Born in Venice, Marco learned the mercantile trade from his father and his uncle, **Niccolò and Maffeo**, who traveled through Asia and met **Kublai Khan**. In 1269, they returned to Venice to meet Marco and the three of them embarked on an epic journey to Asia, exploring many places along the Silk Road until they reached China
- **Travels to China and back (1271-1295)**, is famous for his account of his travels

> Importance of Marco Polo: "That his **"Travels"** became part of Europe’s revision of its world view, a view that was ripe for change as Europe was abandoning the T-O map as it (1) re-discovered the knowledge of the Ancient Greeks and (2) tried to reconcile that with Marco Polo’s description of a much bigger world"

- Marco Polo describes his journeys in a text called **"The Travels"** (written while imprisoned with a cell-mate named **Rustichello**), it was widely popular at the time and contained descriptions, trivia, and legends of all the places he visited however **it came before the invention of the printing press** meaning **each copy had to be written by hand leading to many versions** (many incomplete or altered)
	- Over **100 handwritten copies** were found before the era of printing; Some scholars suggest the variance between copies account for some of the **"inconsistencies"** surrounding his travels
	- "The Travels" is written in a way that **the specific order or route of places Marco Polo visited is ambiguous**

## What was Marco Polo Doing in China?
- There are many theories:
	1. The Polos were stuck in China until the Khan gave them permission to leave
	2. The were developing merchant contracts for trade (when they returned there were lots of gems in their clothing)
	3. They were spies for the Khan
	4. **The Khan preferred to use foreigners to keep an eye on things, especially tax gathering, this may be how he employed Marco in his retinue for a number of years**
	5. **Marco showed himself to be the best describer of the khan’s lands and had a knack of telling Kublai what he had seen,a skill that the Great Kahn liked so much, he sent Marco off round China so he could bring back reports**

- Despite his popularity, many argue **Marco may have never even made it to China**, or at least that much of his descriptions were fabricated; Many such problems were outlined by **Frances Wood** in her book **"Did Marco Polo go to China?"**

## Frances Wood's Major Problems with Marco Polo
1. He does not mention the **Great Wall**, something that would be hard to miss
	- Defense: I was not built at time, at least not all of it
2. He does not mention **tea drinking**, something so common it would be odd not to observe
	- Defense: According to the French scholar M.G. Pauthier, Marco Polo's description of what he though were cloves were more likely to have been Assam (black tea)
3. He does not mention **Chinese block printing** for books, or the use of Chinese writing
	- Defense: In some early editions of the Travels he describes "pamphlets and books", Marco also describes their printing of paper money
4. He does not describe **foot-binding**
	- Defense: He was not likely to see inside Chinese homes
5. He does not mention the use of **chopsticks**
	- Defense: Many travelers at the time also failed to mention the use of chopsticks in Chinese society
6. His vocabulary for places and things almost always uses words of **Persian origin**, not Chinese or Mongol
	- Defense: **This is one of Wood's key arguments**, however defenders say this can be explained as Persian was a **lingua franca** at the time
7. Because he is not clear on the places he visited and those he didn't, **how reliable is he really as an eye witness?**
	- Defense: Marco tells us himself that he will include things he has not himself seen (but these will be things he has heard of that he finds reliable)
8. Since there are sections that report what are clearly myth and legend, **to what extent is he making everything up?**
	- Defense: Marco Polo does have some entirely fictional accounts (such as the battles between the Khan and a legendary Christian king), however much of this can be blamed on **Rustichello** (Marco's Co-writer)

## Why is Marco Polo Important?
- Rather than any information he brought back from his travels, **his importance largely lies in the fact that he made Europe aware of China**
	- The widespread diffusion of his book added to European knowledge of their world (Ex: First introduction of the Europeans to Japan and Java)
	- Europe begins to revise the T-O map
	- **Marco Polo was a key role model for Christopher Columbus**, who extensively annotated his own copy of "the Travels" before his own travels
		- Columbus used Marco Polo's account of his travels to calculate how far China was from Europe
- Marco Polo's importance is purely as a **spokesperson for the existence of a larger world outside Europe**, whatever knowledge he brought back was not of practical importance; **he caused a cultural shift in Europe;s understanding of the world**

# Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
- Hugely influenced by Marco Polo
- **"Discovers" America in 1492**, during the **Renaissance** (rebirth of Classical knowledge in Europe)
- Copies of **Ptolemy's "Atlas"** were rediscovered in Istanbul and translated into Latin in 1410; It is on calculations made by Ptolemy in his atlas (made 1400 years before) that Columbus bases his view of the world’s size
	- Columbus underestimated Ptolemy's calculations of the size of the globe; **He thought he only had 4,000 km to sail, instead of 14,000 km**

- Columbus struggles to reconcile the medieval church’s view of the world with the teachings of the Ancient Greeks, and with the anecdotal evidence of medieval European travelers; **He retains a medieval view of the world**
- **Even to his death, Columbus never grasped the fact that he had reached the New World**; He continued to believe that he had reached China, Japan, the Far East, and a source of spices
	- "Evidence" he used:
		- **Pearls**, found in Costa Rica, when he thought they were only native to Asia
		- **Rhubarb**, Columbus thought he found rhubarb (was likely just roots) because of Marco Polo's mentioning of rhubarb in Asia
		- **Magnetic deviations** (off American coast) that could be signs of a Garden of Eden

# Europe's New World View
- Columbus was only one of a number of European explorers of his time, all of whom **opened up Europe’s world view**
	- **Examples include:** Prince Henry the Navigator (early 1400's), Christopher Columbus (1492), Vascada Gama (1498), John Cabot to Canada (1497)
- These new explorations meant that **Europe was overwhelmed with information about the world**, the following two questions became the goal of geography for the next few centuries:
	1. **How could it be better mapped?**
	2. **How could it be better used?** (to analyze, rather than just describe)

- Eventually, so much information was coming back to Europe from all of the various voyages of exploration, that newer ways of thinking about the world was needed
	- One answer was supplied by a new world map, the **Mercator** (1569)

## Mercator Projection
- New developments such as Mercator’s new world map projection (1569) allowed people to see the world with almost all of its newfound lands (Australia still to be discovered)
	- Gerard Mercator’s (1512-1594) world map was specifically designed as a **navigational chart** of the world
		- **It preserves the correct directional information between places** (you can use the map to plot a followable compass bearing between places)
		- **But distorts area** (especially towards the poles)

# Baron Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859)
- Important early nineteenth-century geographer and explorer of South America
- He wrote a multi-volume work of world  geography called **The Cosmos** (1845-1862)
	- He develops an innovative method of organizing all of the material, that uses a **comparative method**, and has sometimes been called the  **“ecological framework”** as it stressed the association between phenomena (rock, soil,  plants etc); **this was the best way for geographers to organize and analyze data from all over the world**

# Charles Darwin
- **Humboldt’s ecological analysis was replaced as the best way to organize geographical data by Darwin’s ideas on evolution**, presented in his book **On the Origin of Species** (1859)

- Darwin’s ideas were influential in geography because:
	- They could **account for where things were** (the associations of phenomena that Humboldt described)
	- They could **explain how they were related** (within an ecosystem,region, etc.)
	- But also **predict how things could change** or evolve into another over time(species, ecosystems)

- Darwin's ideas slowly transformed 19th century geography and led to the problematic ideas of **environmental determinism**

# Environmental Determinism
> Environmental Determinism ~ 

- Stemming from Darwinist ideas, the belief arose that:
	1. **The environment** always dictated **(determined)** what happened
		- Ex: Environmental determinists stated that in very productive tropical environments, humans did not have to do much to survive and became lazy **(“primitive”)**. In colder environments, people had to work harder and became more inventive **(“advanced’)**; **is suggesting that the state of ones environment is entirely responsible for the advancement of certain group**
	2. **Natural evolution** meant that human societies could be seen as evolving and could therefor be ranked according to their development ("primitive" or "advanced")
		- This is a **problematic idea** as it justifies the dominance of the "advanced" over the "primitive" as they were "less evolved"

- These problematic ideas are known as **"Environmental Determinism"**
	- Has the side effects of **imperialism, ethnocentrism, and masculinism**
	- It a fallacy broadly known as a **deterministic view**

## Refutation of Environmental Determinism
- **Environmental determinism is simply incorrect for three reasons:**
	1. It is **factually wrong**
		- Mayan cities, East Indian architecture, and Australian Aboriginal oral culture are all examples of "advanced" activity in "primitive" cultures
	2. It is **logically flawed**
		- Human societies cannot be put on an evolutionary framework if they all exist today
	3. Based on a **colonial, racist ideology**
		- Relies on colonial categories of "race" which are biologically meaningless

# The "Regional" Approach
- Arises as a solution to the problems and weaknesses of environmental determinism, **puts emphasis on regional description**
	- Argues that the ideal object for geographical study was the **region**

- **Key figures:**
	- **Carl OrtwinSauer** (American geographer)
		- “The Morphology of landscape” (1925); Idea of the **“cultural landscape”**
	- **Paul Vidal de la Blanch** (French geographer)
		- He said over time people and nature **adapt to each other**, like a snail and its shell

- **The regional approach to geography:**
	- Inductive
	- Historical
	- Concerned with the unique
	- Believed that **the environment did not dictate, but rather set boundaries** for what was possible **(possibilism)**
	- Recognized the importance of human culture in providing solutions to environmental challenges

## Regional geography Breaks Down in 1950's
- Why?:
	- Too descriptive
	- Impossible to teach people how to do it
	- No longer "cutting edge" in a post-war era of computers, social science, and academic disciplines involved in planning/prediction of world events/phenomena

**The previous role of geography is now better filled by technological and intellectual advancements in other areas**, geography must remake itself (again)

# "The New Geography"
> "New Geography" = locational/spacial analysis; emergence of geography as a **science** studying the laws governing the geographic characteristics of places

- “New geography” originates from **Fred K. Schaefer’s** paper **“Exceptionalism in geography: a methodological examination”** (1953); 
	- “... geography has to be conceived as the **science** concerned with the **formulation of the laws governing the spatial distribution of certain features on the surface of the earth”** (p.227)
	- Put simply, **the search for the laws of location**, thus the new geography also became known as **“spatial analysis”**. Geography now saw itself as a **science**

## Understanding the World through Models
- **Key texts:** **"Models in Geography"** by Richard J, Chorley & Peter Haggett, **"Locational Analysis in Human Geography"** by Peter Haggett

- Such texts taught the use of general **"models"** to explain human behavior
	- Model = **"Simplification of reality"**
	- Models were often an **equation** but could also be a **diagram**that attempted to explain some spacial phenomenon
		- Ex: **"Gravity model"**, an equation modeling the migration flows of populations between two places
		- Ex: Generalizing shopping behavior into a spacial model

- Crucial to these models are the concepts of **"threshold"** and **"range"**:
	- **Threshold** = minimum population to support a type of retail activity
	- **Range** = max distance people are prepared to travel for that activity
	- **Hierarchy** = level of retail activity or goods

- **A Spatial science:** Overall, the “New Geography” views examines movement, network, node, hierarchy, surfaces, and all aspects of space that can be quantified/measured/seen objectively

## Collapse of the "New Geography"
- "New geography" begins to fall apart during the **1980's** as people find it **too removed from real-world problems**
- It is replaced by a series of more socially-relevant themes such as:
	- **The geography of under-developed areas and social inequality** (based on world-system theory ideas)
	- **The geography of gender** (based on ideas about how cultural construction of gender also structure "space" for people)

- These new directions develop into **"Postmodernism"**
	- Rejects the rationality and science-based approach of spacial geography (arguing it didn't work)
	- Rejects all over-arching theories
	- Rejects universalism
	- Favors the study of the **unique and the local**
		- The study of **"place" as unique phenomena**, and of **"space" as subjective constructions**, are rekindled in the study of geography
	- Increasingly (since 2000) has favored the **self-reflexive** (one's own feelings and reactions)

# Latest Developments in Geography
1. **Actor-Network theory (ANT)**: sees the world as composed of a web of "heterogeneous things" (humans, non-humans, and objects)
	- Recognition of a greater variety of things involved in enacting change (in environments) than just humans
	- Importantly states that **non-humans have just as much "agency" as humans** (ability to make things happen)
2. **Non-representational theory (NRT)**: tries to compensate for ANT’s neglect of human emotion by looking at what is happening outside of conscious thought, the moments of precognition
	- Emphasizes **affect**, defined as **“emotions that are embodied reactions to the social or physical environment”** (Ex: role of music or dance)
