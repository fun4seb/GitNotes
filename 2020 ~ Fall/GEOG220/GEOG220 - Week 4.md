# GEOG220 - Week 4: The Evolution of Human Geography Part 3

# Reading Notes: History of Geography
> Every society can be said to create a geography, both in the sense of an ontology (i.e., as material landscapes and spatial distributions) and in the sense of epistemology (i.e., as a worldview). As long as there have been people, there have been geographies. Australian aborigines, for example, used so-called song lines to navigate the desert. Sumerians developed clay topographies of their cities, and Polynesians crossed the Pacific Ocean with maps of currents and winds made from sticks.

## Definitions
- **Ontology** = the idea of what "is"
- **Epistemology** = the type of approach we use to investigate aspects of what "is" (how we learn)
- **Empirical** = factual/fact-based; based on empirical evidence
- **Paradigm** = currently prevailing set of ideas (Ex: Darwinism as the framework for evolutionary ideas)

## Pre-modern Geographies
- Study of geography has roots in ancient Greece during the sixth century

- **Important Greek figures:**
	- **Anaximander** (610-546 BC) probably created the **first world map**, invented the gnomon, and argued that the Earth and all bodies were spherical
	- **Eratosthenes** (276-194 BC) **coined the term geography** and estimated the circumference of the Earth

- **Important Roman figures:**
	- **Strabo** (64 BC-24 AD)
	- **Ptolemy** (87-150 AD), concluded that the task of geography was to describe the Earth as a whole. He differentiated between **geography (study of universals)** and **topography (study of localities)** and defined chorography as integrating the two

- Geography suffered in feudal Europe due to the dominance of theology, exploration was rare (except for Marco Polo's travels to China), prominence of highly inaccurate **"T-O maps"**
- Despite a lack of progress in Europe, Geography prospered during the height of the **Arab Empire** from the **7th century to the 12th century** as intellectual progress in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine skyrocketed during this period
	- The Arabs traded extensively with India

- **Important Arab figures:**
	- **Ibn Butata** (1304-1369), traveled more than 70,000 miles throughout Eurasia over 30 years
	- **Abi al-Raihan al Biruni** (972-1050)
	- **Ibn Khaldun** (1332-1406)

## The Renaissance and Enlightenment
- Gradual expansion of **capitalism** during the **15th to the 17th century** provided enormous stimulus to geography that was useful in charting avenues of exploration and conquest; mapping land uses and distributions of resources helped Europeans understand the worlds they were conquering
	- Ex: Christopher Columbus was financed by Spain when he accidentally discovered the Americas in 1492
- Cartography advanced rapidly in terms of scope and sophistication in this era; many of the first maps produced then were nautical sea charts
- During the 1400's, **Martin Behaim** in Nuremberg created the **first globe**
- **Gerardus Mercator** (1512–1594), created the famous **Mercator projection** that allowed the use of straight lines or constant compass bearing (a line followed on a map was identical to a line followed across the globe), which was highly useful for long-distance navigation

## The 19th Century
- The Industrial Revolution brought the pragmatic needs for geographic information and saw the founding of geographic societies
- The two leading geographic figures during this period were **Alexander Von Humboldt**, and **Carl Ritter**
	- Von Humboldt is best known for his extensive travels in Latin America (1799–1804) and Siberia (1837–1842). He accumulated vast amounts of empirical data, including plants, volcanoes, and climate
	- Ritter taught geography at Frankfurt and Berlin, traveling some in Europe but not beyond. He is best known for his massive 19-volume Erdkunde, which emphasized the comparison and synthesis of regions as an expression of a religious teleology

> Humboldt and Ritter often are argued to be the founders of the regional approach and scientific geography; however, they differed on several fronts. First, Humboldt was secular, whereas Ritter was religious. Second, Humboldt focused on the physical environment, whereas Ritter focused on human geographies. Third, Humboldt worked at a fine level of areal differentiation, whereas Ritter worked at the scale of continents

## The Development of American Geography
> American geography exhibited several characteristics that differentiated it from its European counterpart. First, it emphasized the physical environment, with close ties to geology and meteorology. Second, there were strong links between American geography and the ongoing colonization of the West; geographers were active in the so-called opening up of the West through their surveys, charts, maps, and photographs throughout the 19th century, transforming what was for Europeans a blank space into a mappable, knowable, and hence controllable space. Third, geography in the United States placed a great emphasis on induction and empiricism (in contrast to European theorizing), fieldwork, and applied pragmatic applications

- **Important American figures:**
	- **George Perkins Marsh** (1801-1882), observed the impacts of American deforestation and became an early advocate for resource conservation. He was widely influential and led to the formation of the National Park Service
	- **John Wesley Powell** (1834-1902), sailed the Colorado river in 1869 while recording Indian customs, mapping the physiographic conditions, and assessing its potential for development

- During the late 19th century, **geography became progressively institutionalized** as a discipline in professional societies and universities
	- In 1851, the American Geographical Society was formed in New York, sponsoring expeditions and the nation's oldest geography journal, the Geographical Review
	- In 1888, the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, began to serve scientists working for the federal government. Under energetic editor Gilbert Grovesner, National Geographic grew rapidly in popularity and subscriptions, helping to bring the geographic imagination of American foreign conquests home to the expanding middle class during and after the Spanish-American War of 1898

## Geopolitics and Environmental Determinism
- During the late 19th century, **classical geopolitics and environmental determinism** arose as geography's first true paradigm, marking a shift in the discipline from a collection of facts to a body of theory. This move was closely associated with the aftermath of the Darwinian revolution and the secular challenge to Christian dogma

> Classical geopolitics, a term coined by Swedish political scientist Rudolf Kjellen, was formalized in the works of Friedrich Ratzel (1844–1904), who gave formal expression to German fears of encirclement at the hands of Russia, France, and Britain. Sometimes called the father of human geography, Ratzel's Anthropogeographie maintained that nation-states could be viewed as organic biological organisms; if they were not growing, they were dying. In their search for living space (or lebensraum), states inevitably would come into conflict (or kulturkampf). Thus, Ratzel's views biologized international relations and were read eagerly by later German leaders, including Adolf Hitler. Nazi geographer Karl Haushofer (1869–1946) was instrumental in this regard.

> As the first ostensibly scientific paradigm in geography, environmental determinism framed the world in terms of  a  hierarchy of competing races in which climate, continents, and ethnic groups were flattened to dichotomies such as civilized versus uncivilized. Geography textbooks often described dark-skinned peoples as indolent and lazy and in need of Western intervention. Ellen Churchill Semple (1863–1932), who studied in Germany with Ratzel, was a prime proponent of this view, arguing in books such as The Influences of Geographical Environment (published in 1911) that climate and topography  exerted essentially uncontrollable influences over people. Ellsworth Huntington (1876–1947) and Griffith Taylor (1880–1963) wrote in much the same vein, a line of thought that culminated in the racist program of eugenics

- Environmental determinism = the environment solely determines human behavior
- **Environmental possibilism** emerged as **determinism** lost favor, it gave much more weight to the capacity of people to shape their own environments

## American Geography during the 20th Century
> Carl Sauer (1889–1975) looms large as the father of American cultural geography. Teaching at Berkeley for three decades (1923–1954), he offered a view of culture that avoided the ugly ethnocentrism that was pervasive in environmental determinism, advocating instead a relativist reconception that uncoupled moral superiority from military or economic might. Sauer's accomplishments include the introduction of the concept of landschaft (landscape) into American geography as both a cultural and natural product, the study of cultural hearths where innovations such as agriculture began, his advocacy of fieldwork (he was an expert on Mexico), and his insistence that cultural geography take historical context seriously

> Isaiah Bowman (1878–1950) was a geographer known mostly for his prodigious administrative and political accomplishments. He studied under Davis at Harvard and participated in the American Geographical Society expedition to Peru that revealed Machu Picchu in 1911. Later, he served as director of the American Geo-graphical Society (1915–1935), taking time in 1919 to work with the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, where he played a key role in drawing the boundaries of the new Europe. A founding member of the Council of Foreign Relations, he became well acquainted with Presidents Woodrow  Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. From 1935 to 1948, Bowman was president of Johns Hopkins University, during which time he also participated in discussions leading to the founding of the United Nations

## Chorology
> In the wake of the collapse of environmental determinism, the discipline embraced a long-standing tradition of chorology, also known as areal differentiation. In Europe, a central figure in this vein was Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845–1918), considered the father of French geography and well known for his studies of small rural areas called "pays" and their associated styles of life (or genres de vies). He also played a central role in the introduction of possibilism to the discipline.  His German counterpart was Alfred Hettner (1859–1941), who argued in the Kantian tradition that geography  consisted of the art of regional synthesis, seeking relations among phenomena that other disciplines ignored

- **Chorology = region**; a focus on the region as a model for study

- In the United States, the most famous advocate of chorology was **Richard Hartshorne (1899–1992)**, who studied under Hettner and then graduated from the University of Chicago in 1924.

- Chorologists maintained that the essence of the discipline was the **description of regions** in all of their glorious uniqueness and complexity, including **cultural and physical phenomena**. Hartshorne argued that the most productive analyses focused on small, relatively homogeneous regions, noting that any deployment of the regional concept was inherently a subjective tool to find meaning in the unwieldy complex of data found in the world. Thus, **regions were mental tools to impose order on chaos**. By eschewing theory, chorology found itself mired in empiricism and the discipline's theoretical and philosophical progress was halted

## Positivism and the Quantitative Revolution
- Starting in the 1950's, the idea of **"positivism"** emerged
	- Positivism embraced the scientific method and relied on older traditions of geometry, physics, German location theory, and neoclassical economics
- Positivism advocated for the **Cartesian view of space (geography as geometry) in which landscapes are reduced to ositropic planes**

> Although highly successful within its own frame of reference, the positivist school also found itself facing heavy criticism. Humanists objected that such an approach might work well in the natural sciences but not in the social sciences. Positivism denied the existence of an observer, offering a false sense of objectivity. Rather, critics alleged, all data are value laden and filtered through theory. Positivism's celebration of quantitative techniques was criticized as sterile and restrictive; mathematics is but one way in which to understand reality and is not always optimal. Finally, Marxists argued  that positivism's ahistorical approach lacked any account of social relations and thus focused on forms rather than on processes

## Marxism
- Drawing on the extensive tradition that began with Karl Marx (1818–1883), geographers during the 1960's and 1970's constructed a view of space and landscape centered on political economy. Although there are many variations of Marxism,  they  share in common a concern for the centrality of class, the production process, and the importance of labor
- Marxist geographers viewed space in explicitly social terms, that is, as a construction of historically contingent social structures and relations. Thus, the introduction of Marxism into geography was the spatialization of Marxism as an analytic tradition

- Critics of the Marxist tradition often pointed to its tendency to **economic determinism**, that is, the reduction of all social issues to labor and production. Others argued that Marxism suffered from an inadequate theorization of human agency and human consciousness
	- Determinism = reductionist = generally arrives at un-holistic conclusions; misses the whole picture

## Humanistic Geography
> Humanistic geographers were concerned with putting people back at the center of social analysis, intersecting with psychology, humanistic philosophy, literary analysis, and linguistics to offer a rich portrait of what it means to be human, that is, to construct webs of symbolic meaning. Jettisoning the myth of objectivity, humanistic geographers argued that understanding comes from shared interpretations and the clarification of values

- Central to the project of humanistic geographers was the work of Yi-Fu Tuan, who redefined the notion of place from a sterile tangible object to the intangible meanings that people give to it. Places, as embodied, erotic, and highly personal locales, were contrasted with space, a more abstract Cartesian notion

- Humanistic geographers focused on how consciousness constructs places through understanding and interpretation, that is,  how landscapes are authored. This line of thought led to the exploration of individual life-worlds  and  the spaces of the body, the most intimate of geographies; bodies appear natural but are social constructions in-scribed  with  social  meanings
	- In so doing, humanism  mounted a serious challenge to both positivism and Marxism, forcing social science to take seriously the implications of human consciousness, for example, in recognizing the role of contingency or the capacity of human actors to do otherwise.

- Criticism of humanism maintained that this perspective lacked a systematic account of social relations, class, power, and production. Thus, humanistic thought centered on an asocial under-socialized view of the individual without reference to mechanisms of social reproduction

## Geography and Feminism
- Geography has long been a male-dominated discipline
- Feminists maintain that social reality is pervasively **gendered** and that gender relations intersect (and often proceed) class, generally as manifested through patriarchy, that is, gender relations that favor men at the expense of women

> To ignore gender is to assume that men's lives are “the norm” and that there is no fundamental difference in the ways in which men and women experience and are constrained by social relations. Widely recognized as the first non-class-based form of social determination to acquire legitimacy, gender has been thoroughly de-naturalized; although gender roles may appear to be natural (i.e., outside of society), they are socially constructed as webs of masculinity and femininity

## Postmodernism and Poststructuralism
> Like humanists, postmodernists argue that every discourse interprets the world from a particular vantage point, that every view is a view from somewhere, and that what one sees depends on where one stands.  Post-modernists maintain that for every topic, there are inevitably many competing discourses, none of which is inherently more correct than the others. Thus, there are no "a priori" grounds for deciding what is true or not. To postmodernists, everything is a discourse because there is no way in which to see the world outside of discourse

- Such a view intersected with the literary tradition of deconstruction in which texts are pulled apart for their diverse and often contradictory meanings. It also borrowed heavily from the work of **Michel Foucault (1926–1984)**, who emphasized that all knowledge is inescapably sutured to **power**; discourses were not simply reflective of the world but rather constitutive of its inhabitants
	- From this view, all grand sweeping views of reality (often labeled **meta-narratives**) sweep a great deal under the carpet, obscuring as much as they reveal

- The essence of postmodernism is that reality is more complex than our languages allow us to admit and that every linguistic construction of order is a simplification and a distortion. Thus, **every representation of reality as well as every discourse is inescapably political**; there can be no divorce between the **ontology and epistemology** of viewpoints

- Like feminism, postmodernism welcomed views from subjugated minorities, the suppressed “other,” and the subaltern in the developing world. Instead, postmodernists ask who it is that gets to decide what constitutes valid, legitimate, correct, or proper discourse. This approach draws from the work of Michel Foucault to argue that power lies at the heart of what is accepted as truth. As an emancipatory political project, this view forced a philosophical shift from the social core to its periphery, from the center to the margins; that is, it required intellectuals to recognize the importance of gender and race not only ontologically (i.e., as parts of social reality) but also epistemologically (i.e., as they pertain to the creation of knowledge)

- Critics of postmodernism accuse it of degenerating into **intellectual nihilism** and **endless relativism** in which all positions come to have equal weight. Some Marxists argue that the postmodern focus on culture and discourse has submerged class as a meaningful social category. Moreover, an overemphasis on difference can be politically dis-empowering because without a common political project resting on common assumptions and values, it is difficult to forge alliances across a diverse social spectrum

## Conclusion
> Geography has served society in numerous ways, including exploration and trade, religious justification, naturalization of colonialism and racism, urban and regional planning efforts, and challenges to inequality. The central thesis here is that there is not one single way in which to view geography but rather a plethora of schools of thought about space that contend and intersect in creative ways. Moreover, geography's history is unfinished given that new ways of looking at space are ever likely to emerge
