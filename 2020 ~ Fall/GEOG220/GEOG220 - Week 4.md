# GEOG220 - Week 4: The Evolution of Human Geography Part 3

# Reading Notes: History of Geography
> Every society can be said to create a geography, both in the sense of an ontology (i.e., as material landscapes and spatial distributions) and in the sense of epistemology (i.e., as a worldview). As long as there have been people, there have been geographies. Australian aborigines, for example, used so-called song lines to navigate the desert. Sumerians developed clay topographies of their cities, and Polynesians crossed the Pacific Ocean with maps of currents and winds made from sticks.

## Pre-modern Geographies
- Study of geography has roots in ancient Greece during the sixth century

- **Prominent Greek geographers:**
	- **Anaximander** (610-546 BC) probably created the **first "world map"**, invented the gnomon, and argued that the Earth and all bodies were spherical
	- **Eratosthenes** (276-194 BC) **coined the term geography** and estimated the circumference of the Earth

- **Prominent Roman geographers:**
	- **Strabo** (64 BC-24 AD)
	- **Ptolemy** (87-150 AD), concluded that the task of geography was to describe the Earth as a whole. He differentiated between **geography (study of universals)** and **topography (study of localities)** and defined chorography as integrating the two

- Geography suffered in feudal Europe due to the dominance of theology, exploration was rare (except for Marco Polo's travels to China), prominence of highly inaccurate **"T-O maps"**
- Despite a lack of progress in Europe, Geography prospered during the height of the **Arab Empire** from the **7th century to the 12th century** as intellectual progress in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine skyrocketed during this period
	- The Arabs traded extensively with India

- **Prominent Arab adventurers:**
	- **Ibn Butata** (1304-1369), traveled more than 70,000 miles throughout Eurasia over 30 years
	- **Abi al-Raihan al Biruni** (972-1050)
	- **Ibn Khaldun** (1332-1406)

## The Renaissance and Enlightenment
- Gradual expansion of **capitalism** during the **15th to the 17th century** provided enormous stimulus to geography that was useful in charting avenues of exploration and conquest; mapping land uses and distributions of resources helped Europeans understand the worlds they were conquering
	- Ex: Christopher Columbus was financed by Spain when he accidentally discovered the Americas in 1492
- Cartography advanced rapidly in terms of scope and sophistication in this era; many of the first maps produced then were nautical sea charts
- During the 1400's, **Martin Behaim** in Nuremberg created the **first globe**
- **Gerardus Mercator** (1512–1594), created the famous **Mercator projection** that allowed the use of straight lines or constant compass bearing (a line followed on a map was identical to a line followed across the globe), which was highly useful for long-distance navigation

## The 19th Century
- The Industrial Revolution brought the pragmatic needs for geographic information and saw the founding of geographic societies
- The two leading geographic figures during this period were **Alexander Von Humboldt**, and **Carl Ritter**
	- Von Humboldt is best known for his extensive travels in Latin America (1799–1804) and Siberia (1837–1842). He accumulated vast amounts of empirical data, including plants, volcanoes, and climate
	- Ritter taught geography at Frankfurt and Berlin, traveling some in Europe but not beyond. He is best known for his massive 19-volume Erdkunde, which emphasized the comparison and synthesis of regions as an expression of a religious teleology

> Humboldt and Ritter often are argued to be the founders of the regional approach and scientific geography; however, they differed on several fronts. First, Humboldt was secular, whereas Ritter was religious. Second, Humboldt focused on the physical environment, whereas Ritter focused on human geographies. Third, Humboldt worked at a fine level of areal differentiation, whereas Ritter worked at the scale of continents
