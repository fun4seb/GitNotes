# GEOG220 - Week 5: The Fundamental Concepts of Geography
- **9 fundamental topics:**
	1. Location
	2. Distance
	3. Space
	4. Accessibility
	5. Spacial interaction (especially **diffusion**)
	6. Scale
	7. Region
	8. Landscape
	9. Place

# Location
- **3 sub-types of location:**
	1. **Absolute location** = exact coordinates (Ex: latitude and longitude)
	2. **Relative location** = (Ex: "near the #24 bus stop")
	3. **Cognitive location** = where a place seems to be; a mental map

## Measuring Absolute Location
> Latitude ~ lines that run **around the globe** (horizontal lines, like the equator) and are of **different lengths**
> Longitude ~ lines that run **through the poles** (vertical lines, the Greenwich Meridian) and are **always the same length**

- Latitude can be found by measuring the **height of the sun**
- Longitude is much harder to determine however by the 18th century it was found that **clocks** could be used to determine longitude by comparing the time aboard the ship to the time ashore, one can then convert the time difference into a "geographical separation" (place it on the map)

- Absolute location can be measured today by using **GPS** (Global Positioning Satellite) information
- In Middle Ages, European navigators relied on instruments such as the **astrolabe** (instrument that finds latitude by measuring the height of the sun)

- **Star navigation** was also an "absolute" method of location
	- Star navigation was used most notably by the **Polynesian indigenous** to travel vast distances by sea without getting lost
- **"Stick charts"** = charts made of sticks to plot more **local information** (location of islands, wind and current patterns, etc.)

# Distance
- **3 sub-types of distance:**
	1. **Absolute distance** = exact distance (Ex: measured in km)
	2. **Relative distance** = measured in time
	3. **Cognitive distance** = how far it seems

- The **"effects of distance"** refer to the fact that **the influence (or importance) of a center diminishes as we get further away from it**
	- Usually that influence will diminish rapidly at first, and then more slowly the further we get away from the center of influence
	- “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”

- The "effects of distance" can be seen to be **weakened with the invention of telecommunications technology**; inventions that are attributed with "making the world smaller" (through increasing the level of global interconnectivity) therefor minimize the "effects of distance"

# Space
- **3 subtypes of space**
	1. **Absolute space**
		- **Space** as a **"geometric container"**; **mathematically** defined, i.e. an area defined by longitude and latitude
	2. **Relative space**
		- A view that sees space as **malleable/changeable**
			- Ex: In socio-cultural space, the countries of the **"West"** are all found close together, irrespective of their absolute location
			- Ex: In economic space, the **"North-South" divide serves as another relative measure of where a country is**
			- - Another example of relative space would be **"personal space"**
	3. **Cognitive space**
		- A View that sees space in terms of peoples beliefs, values, or perceptions
			- Ex: "Mental maps"

- **Henry Lefebvre** (1901-1991); in **The Production of Space** it states there are **3 main processes by which space is "socially constructed"**
	1. Spatial practice: Different economic systems construct space differently; Ex: Capitalism (through private ownership) creates a market in land that leads to geographic inequalities across countries/cities
	2. Representations of space: How power is inscribed in space; Ex: Municipal zoning regulations
	3. Representational spaces: The role of spatial allusions in art or language

# Accessibility
> Accessibility ~ "The opportunity for contact or interaction from a given point or location in relation to other locations"

- Effective accessibility is not only a matter of **distance**, but also the connectivity of networks of **communication** and **transport**

# Spacial Interaction
- “Geographers use the term spatial interactions as a shorthand for all kinds of **movement and flows involving human activity**”
- Textbooks divide "spacial interaction" into **4 subcategories:**
	1. Complementarity: "Can we meet the needs of one place with products from another place?"
	2. Transferability: "Can we move that product?"
	3. Intervening opportunities: "Can we sell that product to an intervening place?"
	4. **Diffusion**: Most important once

## Spacial Diffusion
> Spacial diffusion ~ "The way that things spread through time"

- The **"things"** that spread can be **tangible objects** (both **visible** and **invisible**), or **intangible things** (such as ideas, innovations, fashion, news)
- As things **(phenomena)** spread they **alter/influence the places they spread to**, as well as being **altered themselves as they move**
	- **Phenomena** = Things that are **spreadable from place to place**, can be both **tangible things** (goods, people, resource) and **intangible things** (ideas, culture, information)

- Geographic concept of diffusion = **"Spread of phenomena"** (things: i.e. people, ideas, diseases) from **place to place**, as well as that **spread's consequences**(cultural diffusion, disease diffusion)

### 4 Main Types of Diffusion
1. **Relocation diffusion** = The simple spread of phenomena from place to place
	- Could be something highly valuable such as spices traded between the Far East and Europe
	- Could also be **people** too (such as the case with **migration**)
2. **Expansion diffusion (AKA Contagious diffusion)** = Something that spreads from place to place while **leaving a trace of itself behind as it spreads outwards**; Moves out like a wave across space
	- Most phenomena in a rural society spread this way
	- Key example are **diseases**; spreads out from central place through face to face contact while leaving a trace behind
3. **Hierarchical diffusion (AKA Cascade diffusion)** = The flow of information/ideas **"down" an urban hierarchy** (city > town > village)
	- Important to note that **diffusion can occur more quickly through urban hierarchy than across simple space itself**
	- Most phenomena in a modern, urban society spread this way (because cities and urban spaces are the cultural center)
4. "Mixed diffusion" = Mixture of **spread and hierarchical** diffusion; most diffusion in our society occurs as a mixture of these two types

# Scale
- Scale has two implications for geographers:
	1. In terms of **map scale** = "the ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on the Earth's surface"
		- Essentially **how detailed a map is due to its scale**; Large scale maps have lots of detail, small scale maps have less detail (Atlas projections like Mercator are usually **small scale**)
	2. In terms of **levels of scale** = the concept that there are **various levels of scales of analysis** that are **linked** (local, regional, national, global), also that processes operating at one scale can have significance at other scales

# Region
> Region ~ "A larger-sized territory that encompasses many places, all or most of which share similar attributes in comparison with the attributes of places elsewhere"

- This definition is based on 4 points:
	1. The idea that "region" is used to distinguish one area/region from another
	2. Regions are distinguished on the basis of specific characteristics
	3. Regions **minimize** the variation of the chosen characteristic **within** their boundaries, and **maximize** the variation of the characteristic **across** their boundaries
	4. Regions can be defined on the basis of any characteristic, or group of characteristics

- Key figures of the **"regional approach"**:
	- Carl Ortwin Sauer (USA)
	- Paul Vidal de la Blache (France)
		- Says that human cultures and their physical regions shape each other

- Regions can also be broken up into smaller **sub-regions** (Such as the Caribbean which share characteristics across all islands, however each individual island might have **regional qualities that distinguish themselves culturally or geographically from other islands/regions**)

# Landscape
- Landscape is a **comprehensive product of human action** such that every landscape is a complex repository of society; **humans shape landscapes**

- **Different types of landscapes:**
	- Ordinary (or vernacular); the everyday
	- Symbolic; symbolic, of national identity
	- Work geographers have done that lead to our **appreciation of landscape (aesthetics)**
		- Ex: Picturesque landscapes, Sublime landscapes

# Place
- Place is a concept with two levels of meaning:
	1. An **objective** location that has both uniqueness and interdependence with other places
	2. A **subjective** social/cultural construct; somewhere that has personal meaning for individuals or groups
		- Places can be **personal constructs**, which means each of us has a different “take” on place as the same place can be constructed differently by two or more people. In addition, attitudes towards a place may change over time, so a city could be seen as a layering up of many people’s memories over time. In addition to personal views, we can imagine different cultures’ views of place and finally we realize that there can also be non-places.

- How does place differ from space?
	- **"Place is space willed with meaning"** (Yi-Fu Tuan)

- **"Place-making"** = Any activity that enables place to **acquire meaning**
	- This can be done **intentionally** (malls, restaurants, theme parks, etc.), or unintentionally

- Idea of **mobilities**; seeing place as a focus of **movements/flows** (capital, people, goods, ideas)
