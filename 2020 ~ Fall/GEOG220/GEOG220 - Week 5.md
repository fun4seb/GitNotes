# GEOG220 - Week 5: The Fundamental Concepts of Geography
- **9 fundamental topics:**
	1. Location
	2. Distance
	3. Space
	4. Accessibility
	5. Spacial interaction (especially **diffusion**)
	6. Scale
	7. Region
	8. Landscape
	9. Place

# Location
- **3 sub-types of location:**
	1. **Absolute location** = exact coordinates (Ex: latitude and longitude)
	2. **Relative location** = (Ex: "near the #24 bus stop")
	3. **Cognitive location** = where a place seems to be; a mental map

## Measuring Absolute Location
> Latitude ~ lines that run **around the globe** (horizontal lines, like the equator) and are of **different lengths**
> Longitude ~ lines that run **through the poles** (vertical lines, the Greenwich Meridian) and are **always the same length**

- Latitude can be found by measuring the **height of the sun**
- Longitude is much harder to determine however by the 18th century it was found that **clocks** could be used to determine longitude by comparing the time aboard the ship to the time ashore, one can then convert the time difference into a "geographical separation" (place it on the map)

- Absolute location can be measured today by using **GPS** (Global Positioning Satellite) information
- In Middle Ages, European navigators relied on instruments such as the **astrolabe** (instrument that finds latitude by measuring the height of the sun)

- **Star navigation** was also an "absolute" method of location
	- Star navigation was used most notably by the **Polynesian indigenous** to travel vast distances by sea without getting lost
- **"Stick charts"** = charts made of sticks to plot more **local information** (location of islands, wind and current patterns, etc.)

# Distance
- **3 sub-types of distance:**
	1. **Absolute distance** = exact distance (Ex: measured in km)
	2. **Relative distance** = measured in time
	3. **Cognitive distance** = how far it seems

- The **"effects of distance"** refer to the fact that **the influence (or importance) of a center diminishes as we get further away from it**
	- Usually that influence will diminish rapidly at first, and then more slowly the further we get away from the center of influence
	- “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”

- The "effects of distance" can be seen to be **weakened with the invention of telecommunications technology**; inventions that are attributed with "making the world smaller" (through increasing the level of global interconnectivity) therefor minimize the "effects of distance"

# Space
- **3 subtypes of space**
	1. **Absolute space**
	2. **Relative space**
	3. **Cognitive space**
