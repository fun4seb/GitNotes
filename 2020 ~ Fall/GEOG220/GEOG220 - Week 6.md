# GEOG220 - Week 6: World-System Theory
> "Whoso commands the sea commands the trade of the world; whoso commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world."

- World system theory = **"An interdependent system of countries linked by economic and political competition"**
	- Created by **Immanuel Wallerstein**

- World is structured into a series of **spaces:**
	- **Core** = regions that dominate trade, control technology, have high productivity within diversified economies
		- North America, Europe
	- **Semi-periphery** = regions with dependent and disadvantageous trading relationships, obsolete technologies, and undeveloped economies with low productivity
		- South America, Asia, Australia
	- **Periphery** = regions that are able to exploit peripheral regions, but are themselves exploited and dominated by core regions
		- Africa

- Spaces are **nested**; they **interact, and create each other**
	- The periphery creates the core, and the core creates the periphery; both depend on each other to exist and neither can exist without the other
	- The core actively **undeveloped** the periphery and the periphery **cannot become more developed than the core**

- The core-periphery is **"nested"** at a variety of scales
	- Global, national, regional, across individual cities
	- A place can be core at one level and periphery at another level; Canada as a whole might be core, but individual places within it may be more periphery
	- At each level, the core-periphery processes will create **geographical inequalities**; patterns of disparity are **created and perpetuated**

# World-System History
- World-system begins around **1400** alongside the **European expansion**; there were similar world systems before but they were much smaller
- According to **Wallerstein** this is due to 2 factors within Western Europe
	1. Economic growth
	2. Political changes (essentially the power of the early nation state)

- Western Europe uses the **age of discovery** to integrate "the modern world system"
	- Western Europe first develops the periphery through merchant capital (Ex: French in India)

# Canada: Both Core and Periphery
- Canada is **both a core and periphery**
	- It has, and is, **exploited by colonial/imperial powers** (Britain/USA)
		- Ex: **Staples trap** = over-reliance on export of basic products makes Canada vulnerable to world prices, leaving no alternatives when resource depletion occurs
	- Canada also **exploits other countries**
		- Ex: Canadian banks in the Caribbean, Canadian mining and oil companies operating overseas

- Within Canada there are disparities between average income between the provinces, some are more **wealthy/core**, while others are more **poor/periphery** (Ex: Ontario vs. Nunavut)

# World System: Main Processes
- The world-system is maintained and perpetuated by some key processes:
	1. **Hegemony** = "Domination over the world economy, exercised by **ONE** national state in a particular historical epoch through a combination of **economic, military, financial, and cultural means**"
	2. **Globalization** = "The increasing interconnectedness of different parts of the world through common processes of **economic, environmental, political, and cultural change**"
		- Therefor globalization is nothing more than the **continued operation of the world-system model into the present**

# How Does The Core Perpetuate Itself?
- After an **initial advantage** in which the core takes control of the world system, the core will **continue to dominate the periphery over time**
- The core **perpetuates its dominance** in 4 ways:
	1. **Economically**
	2. **Politically**
	3. **Culturally**
	4. **Environmentally**

## Economically
- The core uses the periphery for:
	- Cheap labour
	- Cheap materials or resources
	- As a large market
	- Commodity chains

- The core **keeps profits** made in the periphery
- The core **eliminates industries** in the periphery

> Neo-Colonialism ~ Economic and political strategies by which the core maintains influence over other areas

- The result: **core-disparity issues**
	- In 2010, 20% of the world's population living in the highest-income countries has 75% of the world's income
	- 3 billion people live on less than 2 dollars a day, while 1000 people have a net worth of 3.5 trillion dollars

## Politically
- The core intervenes in the periphery by **direct or covert military action**
- The core maintains **colonial ties** (Ex: La Francophonie, The Commonwealth)
- The core keeps **periphery in a dependent relationship** (Ex: overseas aid)
- The core keeps **control of world bodies** (Ex: UN, World Trade Organization)

## Culturally
- The core establishes itself as the "cultural leader" in popular and mass culture through **Westernization and Cultural Imperialism** (Ex: Western dominance of the internet)

> Post-Colonialism ~ A set of artistic and political approaches that examine the consequences of the end of colonialism

- **Subaltern Theory** = a theory that examines the ways the colonized margin is culturally dominated by the colonizing center
	- Most important way is through the continued use of the **language of the colonizer** (English, France, Spanish, etc.)
	- Another way is through **ideas** (Ex: Edward Said's book Orientalism outlines how the west created its own vision of the "Orient" and then **imposed that vision/idea** on the Asian lands it dominated, created many of the Asian stereotypes known today)
	- The solution is to **examine the center from the periphery**, in the periphery's own terms
