# GEOG220 - Week 8: Ecological Imperialism
- **From last class:** The core of the world-system maintains its dominance over the periphery...
	- Economically
	- Politically
	- Culturally
	- **Environmentally**; focus of this class
- This class will focus on how the core **maintains dominance through environmental means (Environmental Imperialism)**

# World-System & Environment
- Generally, we expect the core to...
	- **Use the resources of the periphery** (mine, extract, etc.)
		- Ex: The clearance of tropical forests to grow palm oil
	- **Dump its waste and toxic products in the periphery**
		- Ex: Canada shipping its garbage to the Philippines

- Effects are also occur **nested at different scales**, this can be seen at different levels within Canada...
	- **Within Canada at a national scale**: the more "peripheral" communities in the North suffer from **undrinkable water supply** and require a "boil water advisory"
	- **Within Canada at a local scale such as within Montreal**: garbage is dumped in landfills outside the city (NIMBY/"not in my back yard"), or in poorer parts of the city

## Political Ecology
> Political Ecology ~ Way of understanding the world in terms of the levels in which power and politics influence the environmental destruction of the poor

- This means that the geography of environmental destruction reflects a **geography of power and politics**

## Disasters
- Often disasters such as **Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans** or a **landslide in Peru** are aggravated or even "caused" by human action rather than nature
	- Poorer people are forced to live in less desirable areas such as low land (near to flooding) or on steep hillsides where the soil has been destabilized by farming; **This causes the effects of disasters to be exasperated in poor areas**

# The Columbian Exchange

- **"The Columbian Exchange"** = set of theories outlining the effects that the core has on the world's environment; more broadly called **Environmental Imperialism** which means the movement of plants and animals around the globe
	- This is done through the influence of the core and has the effect of **profound change on local ecosystems**
	- Term created by **Alfred Crosby** in his book *The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492*, and specifically refers to the **movement of plants and animals across the Atlantic** (to the New World) following the travels of **Columbus**
		- For Europeans, **The New World offered a huge new range of plants that originated there to be exploited**

- **Alfred Crosby's work** outlines how humans have had a long history with plants and animals:
	1. Process of **domestication** (10,000 years ago)
		- Wheat, sheep, goats in Middle East
		- Pigs, rice in China/South Asia
		- Maize, guinea pig in South and Central America
	2. Plants (and their products) were traded long distances in the medieval period
		- Spices
		- Sugarcane

- A key part of the "Columbian Exchange" is recognizing the effect of the **movement of European diseases upon the indigenous population of the Americas**
	- Populations feel to only **10% of pre-contact level** largely due to diseases introduced by the Europeans

## Reasons for Population Decline in the Americas
1. Human migration: small migrating bands too small to sustain infectious diseases
	- Long migrations of humans across the globe meant that because their population was so small they could not sustain many epidemic diseases, especially if they continued to move (like hunter-gatherers)
2. Development of infectious diseases
	- Many early peoples had migrated across the world **before the domestication of animals** in the Old World began 10,000 years ago and therefor were **not exposed to the development of infectious diseases that were passed from animals to humans** (Ex: small pox coming from cows); groups in the New World have no immunity once they are exposed to Old World (European) diseases

- These reasons resulted in the **"collapse" of indigenous populations**
	- Through the death of many indigenous populations through European introduced diseases, the European colonizers were easily able to subdue large parts of the New World and Australasia
- The population collapse also resulted in the **Atlantic slave trade**, as European colonists sought to **replace missing labour** for mines and plantations (Ex: the silver mines in Potosi, Bolivia)

## Movement of Plants during the "Columbian Exchange"
- **Potato:**
	- 10,000 BP (before present): Domesticated in Peru
	- 1536: the Spanish conquer Peru
	- 1600: potato reaches Basque region
	- 1650: potato taken to Ireland (having four times the yield of rye)
	- 1680's-1780's: potatoes spread to Belgium, Germany, Poland
	- By 1670's colonists began growing potatoes in Virginia
- The introduction of the potato enabled Europe to **grow rapidly and to support its industrialization and urbanization**
- Example of plant migration from **New World to Old World** (Americas to Europe)

- **Tulip:**
	- Tulip's "homeland": mountains of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan
	- 1554: reported in Constantinople
	- 1559: reaches Vienna
	- 1565: reaches Holland
	- 1642: reports of planting in New York City
- Example of plant migration from **Old World to New World**

- Alfred Crosby widens his take on how the core dominates with his 1986 idea of “Ecological Imperialism”:
	- Crosby argues that a major factor in Europe's colonial success was **not military power but ecological power**
	- Europe succeeded in colonizing many **temperate** parts of the world:
		- North America
		- Argentina
		- South Africa
		- Australia & New Zealand
	- Because **temperate places had similar climates**, the introduction of European plants and animals (as well as microbes and weeds) could easily replace native flora and fauna

# Ecological Imperialism
- Similar to the "Columbian Exchange" but much more broad, concerning the movement of plants and animals **globally** rather than specifically between the **Old and New World** (Americas and Europe)
	- At this wider scale (not just crossing the Atlantic), ecological imperialism involved the colonial powers **moving plants and animals around the entire globe and at speeds much greater than before**

## Movement of Plants during Ecological Imperialism
- **Pineapple:**
	- Domesticated  in S. America
	– “Before the end of the sixteenth century, the pineapple had spread across much of the tropical world”; the Spanish take it west from South America to Philippines and China; Portuguese take it from Brazil eastward to Africa and India
	– By 1670's Dutch first succeed in growing in Europe
	– By 1720's craze for growing them spread to England (use of “pineapple pit")
	– First reach Hawaii in 1790's

- **Breadfruit:**
	- Originally domesticated in Indonesia and spreads east into Oceania
	- 1792-1793 taken from Tahiti to St Vincent in Caribbean by Captain Bligh; intended to act as food supply for slaves on plantations

## Consequences of Ecological Imperialism
- The flora and fauna of **different pats of the world** become increasingly **homogenized**
	- The tropics now look the same everywhere; Bananas, royal palm trees and pineapples seem so much a part of the Hawaiian landscape that it is a shock to discover that these are all introduced species
	- By the same token, Canadian gardens in the summer are made up almost entirely of introduced species, and yet they are now so familiar to us now that we can no longer sense how “out of place” they really are
