# GEOG220 - Week 8: Topophilia
- Topophilia = **"love of place"**
	- Place is defined as **space filled with meaning** (Yi-Fu Tuan)

- Yi-Fu Tuan argues that we develop our "love of place" for **4 reasons**:
	1. **Home:** our love of "home" is very powerful
		- The place we grow up in leads to **nostalgia**
		- **Heritage Tourism** = individuals who are interested in their own family background travel to ancestral homelands and gravesites (Ex: tourism of the Scottish diaspora to ancestral homelands)
	2. **Memory:** place is a way of solidifying memory; a way of capturing time
		- **Marlene Creates** (Canadian artist/poet) uses **"memory boxes"** to show how memory related to place is **gendered**; **examines place, not as a geographical location, but as a process that involved memory**
			- Ex: **Male memories of Newfoundland:** knew and described in great detail the shores and fishing grounds offshore (memories centered around the sea)
			- Ex: **Female memories of Newfoundland:** knew and described in great detail the layout of their village, visits to neighbors, school, etc. (memories centered around the village)
			- Memory boxes can then be plotted geographically on a map showing the areas related to the gendered memories of individuals to create **memory maps**
	3. **Sacred:** places have a deep spiritual meaning for people
		- Shrines
		- Pilgrimages
	4. **Imagination:** physical places become the anchor for the mind's creation
		- Tolkien, Game of Thrones, Disneyland
		- Las Vegas

# Affect
- **Affect** = an emotional, almost unconscious, reaction to the environment
	- **Emotion:** could be shivers or a feeling (frisson)
	- **Environment:** could be social, cultural, or physical environment
	- These emotions may result in, or enable, some type of action

- Some writers have suggested that if we agree to believe that plants, animals, rocks or the natural landscape itself have some sort of **agency** (ability to make things happen) then they too possess some power of **affect**
	- This means that **humans and non-humans are equally important in shaping the world** (Bruno Latour's idea of **actor-network theory**)

# Group Perspective of Place
- Communities are made up of **groups of people**, each with their own different perspectives of place **creating many different individual "topophilias"**

- **Topophilias can change over time:**
	- As people die and their memories fade
	- As we change how we wish to evaluate or memorialize individuals (changing street names, demolition of monuments/statues)
	- As settlers erase the landscape and names of indigenous groups

- It is difficult to generalize from each person's unique experiences of "place", however we can generalized how each **culture** creates its own "place" or **"region"**; related to Vidal de la Blache and Carl Sauer's work on **"cultural landscapes"**
- Cultural geographers examine the features of the cultural landscape that make each cultural region **unique** and are typical of that region:
	- Folk ("vernacular") architecture
	- Folk music
	- "Ethnic"/"regional" cuisine
	- Regional accents and dialects

## Lieux de Mèmoire
- Idea from French historian, **Pierre Nora**
- Lieux de mèmoire = "sites of memory"; places that are important to a group (Ex: historical battlegrounds)

- We often see plaques or statues used at a place to commemorate the site of memory in order to preserve the memory
	- Shows how "place" and "memory" for a group can become intimately related

# Cultural Landscape
- Group love of place is used to make a **"cultural landscape"**
- **Cultural landscape** = the result of the activities of a particular **culture** working over **time** to reshape the existing natural landscape

## Sauer & De la Blache
- Two geographers that argued that **each culture uniquely shapes, and is shaped by, its physical environment**, producing its own cultural landscape that reflects and interacts with the physical environment and the culture who inhabits it
	- Blache's metaphor of the snail and its shell

### Caribbean: Natural and Cultural Landscapes
- The Caribbean has two basic **natural landscapes**, one based on **volcanoes (lava)** and one based on **coral (limestone)**
- The Caribbean also has many different **cultural landscapes** that arose as a result of European colonization of the islands (Spanish, French, Dutch, English), each with different laws, language, food, etc., that all come together to create visibly different **cultural landscapes**

- Sauer's basic point is that **just as we can see a physical landscape, we can also see a cultural landscape**
	- **Origin of the word "landscape":** from the Dutch "landskip"; an area of land "improved" through human efforts

## "Ordinary" & "Spectacular" Landscapes
- **Spectacular:**
	- People are attracted, through their love of "place", to the **spectacular** (mountains, lakes, landscape gardens)
	- Our sense of the spectacular is a **created aesthetic** which changes over time and is **culturally based**
	- Spectacular landscape features contribute to a places cultural identity (Ex: The Grand Canyon)

- **Ordinary:**
	- Most geographers would say we study the **everyday world of people**, the ordinary landscape, or the **"vernacular"**
		- **"Vernacular"** = "native" or "from the land of one's birth"
	- Ex: geographers such as **Terry Jordan and Wilbur Zelinsky** who focus on the "ordinary", as much of their work deals with issues such as **folk housing** 
	- Ex: growing number of non-fiction writers such as **Tim Robinson and Robert Macfarlane** who are focusing on landscape, place, and personal attachment
		- **Tim Robinson - Aran Islands of Ireland**
			- The key to his work is that he identified the original name in Gaelic of every rock, path, landscape feature on the islands
			- "In a personal encounter with the landscape and its folklore, Robinson circles the entire island in clockwise, sunwise, fashion in search of the “good step” in which walking itself becomes a form of attention and contemplation”
		- **Robert Macfarlane**
			- "The power of language to shape our sense of place"

# Non-Places
- Idea of "non-places" and a sense of "placelessness"
- **Topophobia** = fear of places
- Most prevalent geographer related to this is **Ted Relph** (student of Yi-Fu Tuan)

# "Place Marketing"
- By understanding the love of place we can also see how **place is used in selling things**
- "Place marketing" = commodification and **profiting** off of place
	- Ex: Niagara Falls and other **tourist destinations**; example of **profiting off of the "spectacular"**
	- Ex: **Heritage tourism** of the Scottish diaspora

# "Castaway" Discussion Conclusions
1. Draw a picture of the house you would build to live in (we imagine that you have all of the materials you will need)
	- We all build from what we know –so each culture reinvents itself and builds designs it is familiar with, even in different environments (at least at first –some adaptation may later occur)
2. Draw a picture of a religious site you would construct
	- Not quite the same answer because religious architecture is often very tradition-bound and will not change, even in a new environment. Sometimes, the religion lays  down rules for the design.
3. Write down the name of the food you would miss most
	- I suggest it is “comfort food” –the food of our childhood for which we have the most nostalgia
4. Write down the name of the restaurant that would be the very first one you would go to after you are rescued (and why?)
	- ideas??
5. What song would you use on either happy or sad occasions?
	- The work of great folk musicologists (like Heather Creighton of Nova Scotia) shows that the tunes of songs are easily remembered and more easily taken to a new land. The words, however, are soon forgotten –and so, likely, often just rewritten
6. What else would you miss?
	- Family and friends --The results of a lot of disaster relief work shows the one thing people most wished they had saved from their ruined house are photos of family. Interestingly –to a geographer –not places!!
7. What would you like about your new environment?
	- Some tell me peace, quiet, nature..... Enjoy!!
