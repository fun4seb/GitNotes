# GEOG220 - Week 9: Vernacular architecture

# “Ordinary” Landscapes
- **Ordinary**
	- Most geographers would say we study the everyday world of people, **the ordinary landscape, the “vernacular”**
		- **“vernacular”** = “native” or “from the land of one’s birth”
			- derived from the Latin word vernaculus, “a slave born in his/her owner’s house”)
		- Examples: Terry Jordan, Wilbur Zelinsky. Much of their work deals with issues such as folk housing and we can look at some of this as an example

## Vernacular Architecture
- We use “vernacular architecture” as one of the guides to **what are distinctive features of a cultural region**; other distinctive features include:
		- Language (accents)
		- Music (folk music .... )
		- Food (local “iconic foods” such as smoked meat

- **“Vernacular architecture” can be:**
	- The oldest types of building (“folk architecture”)
	- Built using local materials, old designs and old artisanal construction ways
	- 17th, 18th, 19th century buildings that are likely more adapted to the local environment, and built with more modern, industrial techniques
	- Or very modern types of building –such as skyscrapers –that are found in an area.•The key is that vernacular architecture is typical (diagnostic) of a cultural region

# USA Folk Housing
- The basic argument is that the basic form of the classic small English or Irish cottage was the origins of the US house in Eastern USA, but that it soon altered its design [depending on which of the 3 main cultural hearths of the US we look at] into these 3 new types:
	- **New England (The Cape Cod house)**
	- **Mid-Atlantic (The “I” house)**
	- **Southern/ Lower Chesapeake/Tidewater (The Tidewater house)**

- This basic cottage design is brought by settlers to three different parts of Eastern USA; These are called “cultural hearths” as these are regions where some very distinctive different patterns of life are developed by the early European settlers
	- English cottage morphs to **Cape Cod** or **Salt Box** types in the **New England hearth**
	- English cottage morphs to **"I" house** in the **Middle Atlantic hearth**
	- English cottage morphs to **tidewater raised cottage** in the **Southern hearth**

- Once established in these three regions, these three types then become the standards that are then taken out across over much of the USA by subsequent waves of migrants (diffusion)

- **Other folk housing types:**
	- Out west, another “cultural hearth”; based on Spanish mission styles
	- Two original types are not based on the one room English cottage:
		- The **“shot-gun”** (according to scholars **this design was probably brough from W. Africa, via Haiti**; from original word “shogun”)
			- Appears in Jordan's "Southern Hearth"
		- The **log cabin** (from North and Central Europe; Sweden, Switzerland, Germany)
			- Found in Jordan's Middle Atlantic hearth

# Log Cabins
- Terry Jordan shows the log cabin is a design from N and central Europe; not “invented” in the forests of the USA
	- Examples of Scandinavian joints were researched by him in the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm
	- His research uncovering their origins in Northern and Central Europe was based on patterns of joints

- Barns were raised up away from rats

# Canada Folk Housing
- Patterns of folk and vernacular housing are different in Canada than the USA; Why?
	- Different history of settlement and immigration
	- Different chronology

- **Regional folk housing influences:**
	- **Quebec 17/18th century:** folk housing based on cottages found in France (roof later modified for snow)
	- **Ontario late 18th/early 19th century:** stone farmhouses built by Loyalists from the USA
	- **Newfoundland 18/19th century:** Irish/British fishing people bring designs
	- **Prairies late 19th century:** many Central European designs (i.e Ukrainian)
	- **BC late 19th/early 20th century:** “bungalow” design

- Two of these basic types later **“urbanize”**:
	- The Ontario farmhouse
	- The Quebec farmhouse –into Montreal duplexes, triplexes (although, note research by David Hanna of UQAM suggests Scottish tenement origins)

- Greater relevance of folk housing?
	- As a **"place maker"**, as planners and builders self-consciously use older styles to give new construction greater allure; playful use of different architectural styles in one building is a hallmark of **"postmodernism"**

# Place Marketing
- Seen in postmodern references to the the past (deliberate use of retro architectural styles)
- The past = "an assurance of quality"
	- Ex: The "cottage" design is seen in 1930's gas station design in the USA
- **"Facadism"** = original front kept on a new building; indicates value of heritage?
