# GEOG272 - Midterm Notes
> Rough last minute notes for the midterm

- **The geographic grid:** a system of geometrical coordinates used in designating the location of places on the surface of the earth
	- Latitude and longitude; latitude is more important as conditions change radically depending on the latitude being observed; two places with different longitudes are extremely similar in climate as the distance from the equator is equal however two places with different latitude can have vastly different climates
	- Latitudinal geographic zones

- Hydrological cycle; how the world climate systems interact
	- Wind is a result of incoming solar radiation that causes pressure differentials within the atmosphere allowing for the flow of air

- Energy surplus that takes place over the equator, build up of heat that is stored at the surplus zones around the equator that is then distributed to energy deficit zones found in the poles through **atmospheric circulation**

- Axial parallelism: as the earth revolves around the sun its axis is always parallel with itself at any point in the revolution

- Sub solar point is about 23.5 S latitude; tropic of Capricorn
- heterosphere ( more things changing and happening; more dynamic ranges high up in the atmosphere) and homosphere (closer to the planet and more stable)
	- All weather and thing that affect us directly are found in the Troposphere

- Natural favors affecting pollution: winds, local and regional landscapes

- Different clouds have different effects on the atmosphere as reflect more or less insolation
- Contrails that found into cirrus clouds

- heat flow stops when temperatures are about
	- sensible heat is heat we can feel (can be measured with a thermometer), 
		- Sensible heat flux: heat flows from the usually warmer ocean to the cooler atmosphere via sensible heating
		- high sensible heat in environments lead to dryer, hotter conditions like that of a desert
	- latent heat is a energy absorbed or released **during a change in state** (cannot be measured with a thermometer)
		- high latent heat in environments means healthy amounts of state changes and allows more greener landscapes
	- Convection: heat rising and cooler molecules descending; circular effect
		- convection currents: heat rising and falling in a cycle like steam in a closed pot
	- Conduction: heat transfered through contact (rod getting hot in a flame)
	- Radiation is energy moving through space in one direction; not circular

- fundamental difference in heat held by land and heat held by water; **specific heat**
	- heat held by land heats quickly, no penetration of radiation, and is not stored for long
	- heat held by water heats slowly, mixes with warm and cold currents, radiation penetrates deeply and is stored for much longer than on land

- kinetic energy is the vibration of molecules that we measure as temperature; as temperature increases air volume increases; a decrease in volumes corresponds to a decrease in temperature if pressure is to remain the same
	- the higher the temperature the greater the kinetic energy as molecules look for a place to go (expand); if in a container the molecules will hit a surface and increase the pressure on that surface as temperature (and therefor volume) rises (think pressure cooker)

- isobars: differentiation in hot and cold pressure zones; closer isobars create stronger winds (stronger pressure gradient force)
	- high pressure zones tend to move into low pressure zones; **high to low**
	- gradual pressure gradient = farther isobars = lighter winds; steep pressure gradient = closer isobars = stronger winds
	- determine the direction and speed of wind as it takes the path of least resistance into low pressure zones
	- Hurricanes and storms create low pressure systems off the coasts
- Geostrophic winds run **parallel to the isobars** causing the winds to be strong, fast, and free of friction; not subject to friction force; influences by the Coriolis effect (rotation of planet); occur in the upper parts of our atmosphere
- areas of convergence aloft (corresponding to surface divergence) and divergence aloft (corresponding to surface convergence)
	- winders descend onto the surface from upper air winds in a cyclone to create high pressure systems and winds from the surface cyclone up to meet the upper air winds from the bottom to create low pressure systems; air crashing down creates high pressure while air rising up creates low pressure
- constant isobaric surface, place where the area is covered in millibars up in the atmosphere

- Polar cell: polar easterlies = surface wind; severe cold = driver
- Ferrel cell: westerlies = surface wind; eddy effect
- Hadley cell: trade winds = surface wind; intense heating = driver
- ITCZ = intertropical convergence zone; IMPORTANT
- polar front: boundary between cold polar air mass and warm tropical air mass
	- polar jets are responsible for the movement of giant air masses across the planet

- three levels of atmospheric circulation:
	1. primary: general worldwide circulation
	2. Secondary: migratory high-pressure and low-pressure systems
	3. tertiary: includes local winds and temporal weather patterns

- positive charges within molecules attract negative charges (polarity)
	- polarity allows water to dissolve many substances such as minerals leading to "pure" water to be rare in nature
- hydrogen (+) and oxygen (-) readily form covalent bonds which are **difficult to separate** = stability = **hydrogen bonding**
	- hydrogen bonding allows water and ice molecules to attract each other to form a liquid or solid, otherwise water would be a gas at normal surface temperatures; keeps clouds together

- dominant cooling process in earth's energy budget is the **latent heat of evaporation**
- at **20 degrees C** every gram of water that evaporates from a surface must absorb **~585 calories** (Ex: cooling of skin when wet)

- relative humidity = actual water vapor in air / max water vapor possible in the air at that temperature X 100
	- 50% humidity therefor means that air can hold 50% more water vapor before it reaches its **maximum levels of vapor saturations**
- **Dew point** is the temperature at which air becomes fully saturated with water; the dew point formula relies on data including the relative humidity and ambient air temperature of a given place
	- examples include mist evaporating off mountains or condensation of a cold glass of water
- specific humidity = actual amount/mass of water vapor being held at a particular point

- adiabatic processes = lifting and movement VERICALLY of giant air packets; such processes determine atmospheric stability which affects cloud formation and precipitation patterns (weather)
	- an ascending parcel of air tends to **cool by expansion**
	- a descending parcel of air tends to **warm by compression**
- a particular air parcel can be either stable or unstable

- stability refers to the tendency of an air parcel to either remain in place (stable) or change vertical position by ascending or descending (unstable)

- **dry adiabatic rate** (DAR): rate at which dry air cools by expansions as it rises or heats by compression as it descends (before it reaches saturation); dry = less saturated with moisture
- **moist adiabatic rate** (MAR): rate at which a moist (saturated) ascending air parcel cools by expansions
	- MAR is lower than DAR due to latent heat of condensation; MAR is much lower than DAR in warm air but two rate are similar in cold air

- atmospheric science: understanding the layer of gases that surround our/any planet
- climatology: study of climate, study of weather patterns over longer time periods and larger in spatial extent
- meteorology: the study of weather, the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place
	- Meteor: phenomenon observed in the atmosphere or on the surface of the earth
- Elements of weather: atmospheric pressure, clouds, precipitation, wind, temperature, and humidity; all in a constant state of change

- Air masses = large bodies of air; form over long flat regions and have a **source region**
	- m = maritime; c = continental; t = tropical; e = equator; a = arctic; etc.

- Fronts = transition zones where air masses of warmer regions meet air masses of colder regions; leading edge of air masses (ex: warm fronts, cold fronts, occluded fronts, stationary fronts)

- wave cyclone = contrasting air mass = mid-latitude cyclone
- thunderstorms characterized by **turbulence** created by the mixing of air of different densities; accompanies by lightning and thunder
	- depends on **wind sheer** = the variation of wind speed and direction with latitude
- supercells = huge updrafts; **mesocyclone** = spinning cyclonic rising column of air associated with a **convective** (rising and falling) storm, up to 20 km in diameter; results in heavy rain, large hail, heavy winds, lighting

- enhanced Fujita scale (tornado classification)
- tropical cyclones (also called typhoons, hurricanes, or cyclones) only occur in maritime regions and require warm air + warm sea (lots of latent heat to supply energy)
	- convert heat energy into mechanical energy (motion)
	- move of their own accord until they hit a coastline and begin to break up
	- graded in severity using the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (category 1,2,3, etc.)

- NOAA = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, agency that focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere
