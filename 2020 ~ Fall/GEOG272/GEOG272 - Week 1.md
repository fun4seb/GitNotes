## What is Geography?
- Study of **spacial variation**
	- How/why things differ from one place to another
	- How/why particular patterns develop over time

## 5 Major Themes of Geographic Education
1. Location
2. Region
3. Human-Earth relationships
4. Movement
5. Place

- Important methodologies:
	- **Spatial analysis** of systems and activities over time and spaces
	- **Process analysis** (actions or mechanisms that operate in some special order)

## 3 Main Interests of Geographic Subfields
> Physical geography ~ Studies components and systems that make up the environment: energy, air, water, weather, climate, landforms, soils, animals, plants, micro-organisms, and the Earth itself

> Human geography ~ Study of where people are (and how they got there), what they are like, how they interact over space & time, how they interact with the environment

1. **Spatial variation of physical and human phenomena** on the surface of the earth; relationships between human societies and the natural environments that they occupy and modify
2. **Systems that link phenomena** and human activities in one area of the earth with other areas
3. **Regional analysis**; ecological relationships and spatial systems in specific locational settings (regional geography)

## Size & Scale
- Scale tells us the relationship between the **size of an area on a map** vs. **actual size of the mapped area on the surface of the earth**

- Geographic studies may be broad or narrow, occurring at many different sizes/scales (global scale, regional scale, micro scale, etc.)
	- Ex: Study of climates vs. micro-climates

# A Systems Approach
> Systems Theory ~ States that a system is any set of ordered, interrelated components and their attributes, linked by flows of energy and matter, as distinct from the surrounding environment outside the system

- Contains **elements/characteristics** which may be arranged in a series, or intermingled
	- May comprise any number of "sub-systems"

- Within Earth's systems, both **matter and energy** are stored and retrieved; energy is transformed from one type to another
	- **Matter** = mass that assumes a physical shape and occupies shape
	- **Energy** = a capacity to change the motion of, or to do work on **(change)**, matter

## Open & Closed Systems
- A **closed** system (Ex: fish tank) has no input or influence from any outside forces independent of it (rarely happens in the real world)
- An **open** system (Ex: lake) requires, and is constantly influenced by, **inputs from the outside**. Open systems also **produce outputs** which affect the environment around the
	- **Most systems are open**
	- The earth is comprised of a network of mainly open systems, taking input and producing output to constantly influence each other

### The Earth as an Open System
- **In terms of energy**, the earth is an open system as energy enters and leaves over time
	- **Most natural systems are open in terms of energy**
- **In terms of matter**, the earth is a closed system as no substantial amounts of matter add or subtract itself from the system of earth (with the exception of the output of atmospheric gases into space, and the input of meteors and cosmic dust

#### Examples of Sub-Systems within the Earth
- River systems
- Coastal systems
- Oceanic systems
- Atmospheric systems
- Ecosystems

## System Feedback
- As a system operates it generates outputs that influence its own later outputs, "information" is reintroduced back into the system through various pathways creating a **feedback loop** of endless influence
- Negative feedback vs. positive feedback:
	- **Negative feedback** = discouragement of change in a system, leading to stability or self-regulation
	- **Positive feedback** = encouragement of change in a system creating a "snowball effect", leading to instability and disruption (often causing the death of organisms within a system or the death of the system altogether)
		- **Climate change is a key example of positive feedback loops** (endless change of ecosystems, endless instability)

- Depending on the feedback, a systems can be understood to exist in **two types of equilibrium**
	- Systems fluctuate between **steady-state and dynamic equilibrium**

### Steady-State Equilibrium
> Steady-state equilibrium ~ "Most systems maintain structure and character over time. An energy and material system that remains balanced over time, in which conditions are constant or recur, is in a steady-state condition"

- When the rates of inputs and outputs in the system are equal, and the amounts of energy and matter stored within the system is constant (or fluctuates around a stable average)
	- Ex: Rivers that naturally regulates flow as shifting sediment controls an average speed of the stream
- Also refers to when a system has reached a point of little/no change, remaining constant over time; Outside influences are minimal, the characteristics/properties of the system do not change over time

### Dynamic Equilibrium
> Dynamic Equilibrium ~ When a previously steady-state system demonstrates a changing trend over time

- **When a previously steady system undergoes changes due to growing external influences/disruptions (thresholds/tipping points)** that cause the system to correct and reinvent itself; most systems are constantly being influenced and transformed over time
- Much more common than steady-state equilibrium
- Changes may appear gradually and are compensated for by the system
- **Functional operations/characteristics of the system are maintained, resisting abrupt change**

- **Thresholds/tipping points**: Changes (outside) to the system which move it away from equilibrium **"branching into a new operational level"**
	- As a previously steady system gets disrupted, it becomes dynamic and undergoes changes to correct itself, finally returning to a steady state that may operate differently compared to its previously steady state
- **Models of systems:** Representations of real-world situations; computer-generated, physical models, etc.

# Environmental Spheres
- Understanding the earth through **"Environmental Spheres":**
	- Biosphere
	- Atmosphere
	- Hydrosphere
	- Lithosphere
	- ALSO IMPORTANT: **Cryosphere**

# The Sun
- The Sun of our galaxy is average in temperature, size, and color
- Captured about 99.9% of matter from original solar nebula
	- Remaining 0.1% formed planets, their satellites, asteroids, comets and cosmic debris
- High pressure and temperature at the core
	- **Hydrogen (H) atoms are forced together and pairs of H nuclei are joined,** this is called **"fusion"** 
- During a fusion reaction H nuclei form helium, releasing energy in the process; **"Disappearing solar mass becomes energy"**

> Sunspots ~ Surface disturbances caused by magnetic storms (storms can be 12 times the size of earth)

- Distances in earth-sun relationship:
	- Earths average distance from sun: **150,000,000 km**, the light reaches earth in **8 min 20 sec**
	- Earth average distance from moon: **384,000 km**, the light reaches earth in **1.28 sec**
	- Speed of light: **~300,000 km/second**
		- Known observable universe is **~12 billion** light-years in all directions

## Heliophysics & Space Weather
> Heliophysics ~ Study of the sun and its interactions with earth and solar system

> Space Weather ~ Refers to conditions on the sun, in the solar wind, and within Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems and can endanger human life or health.

### Solar Wind
> Solar Wind ~ Electrically charged particles surging outward from the sun; Solar wind requires ~3 days to reach earth 

> Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) ~ Outbursts of charged material (from the sun); Besides emitting a continuous stream of plasma (solar wind), the sun periodically releases billions of tons of matter in what are called coronal mass ejections. These immense clouds of material can cause large magnetic storms in the space environment around Earth, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere.

> Magnetosphere ~ Earth's magnetic field, generated by "dynamo-like motions"

- Solar outputs = solar wind and **radiant energy** (Radiant energy is a key topic in this course)
- In addition to solar wind, **massive outbursts of charged materials called coronal mass ejections**, contribute to the flow of solar wind and when directed at the earth create **auroras** in the upper atmospheres near the poles

#### Auroras
- Occur when solar winds make contact with the Earth's magnetosphere and are concentrated towards the poles in the upper atmosphere (80-500 km), resulting in displays of light known as auroras
	- Aurora **Borealis** = north; aurora **Australis** = south

## Radiation & Insolation
> Insolation ~ Incoming Solar radiation

- Insolation varies with:
	- Angle of incident radiation (tilt of the earth)
	- Photoperiod (length of sun exposure over a day, varies with seasons and earths rotation around sun)
	- **Diurnal** and **annual** cycles
		- Sun exposure is an example of a **diurnal cycle**, earths rotation around the sun is a **annual cycle**
	- **Solar constant** = total solar irradiance; amount of solar radiation received by earth at an altitude of 480 km within the earth's **thermopause** (outer boundary of earth's energy system)

> Diurnal Cycle ~ Any pattern that recurs every 24 hours as a result of one full rotation of the earth

> Annual Cycle ~ Any pattern that recurs every years as a result of one full rotation of the earth around the sun

- Incoming **shortwave** radiation from the sun is absorbed by the earth and retransmitted into space as **longwave** radiation ("All energy generally wants to return to space")
	- Important to have a balance of **incoming solar radiation** and outgoing **longwave radiation** to keep temperatures constant
	- **The sun emits its energy in the form of shortwave radiation due to its heat**, while the earth is much cooler and emits its energy in a much longer wave of radiation **(shortwave vs. longwave radiation)**
		- This phenomena is known as **Wien's Law** (will be discussed more later)

### Physics Terminology
- **Spectrum** = all possible wavelengths of electromagnetic energy **(light)** emitted by a body exist within a spectrum of possible values; portions of the electromagnetic spectrum of radiant energy are either **visible or invisible** to the human eye
- **Velocity** = distance/time; rate of movement in some direction
- **Wave** = a disturbance or variation that transfers energy progressively from point to point in a medium
	- **Wavelength** = a distance between corresponding points on any two successive waves
	- short- vs. medium- vs. long- wave radiation
- **Frequency** = the number of waves passing a fixed point in 1 second
	- Low frequency = **longwave**
	- High frequency = **shortwave**
- **Intensity** = the amount of solar radiation striking an object (expressed in watts)
