# GEOG272 - Week 12: Global Climate Systems
- Insolation; energy balance; temperature; air pressure; air masses; atmospheric moisture
- World climate classification
- Climographs
- Six basic climate categories

# Insolation
- Incoming solar radiation
- Varies with:
	- Angle of incidence radiation
	- Photoperiod
- Diurnal and annual cycles
- **Solar constant** = total solar irradiance; amount of solar radiation received by Earth at altitude of **480 km** within the Earth's **thermopause** (outer boundary of Earth's energy system)

## Earth's Energy Balance

## Energy Surplus & Deficit

# Relevant Concepts

## Temperature
- Daily radiation and temperature curve
	- Surplus absorbed insolation peak at noon
	- 3 hour "lag" between peak insolation and warmest time of day

## Air Pressure

## Air Masses

## Atmospheric Moisture

## Different Ways of Classifying Climates
- **Charles W. Thornthwaite** (1899-1963)
	- Geographer and climatologist
	- Identified regions according to moisture, using aspects of the water-budget approach and vegetation types
	- Creator of "water-budget" methodology
	- Recognized the relationship between water supply and demand as it varies with climate

- **Wladimir Koppen** (1846-1940)
	- Meteorologist and climatologist
	- The Koppen-Geiger classification uses average monthly temperatures, precipitation, and total annual annual precipitation
		- Canada is labeled under "Severe Midlatitude Climates"; **humid continental/subarctic & no dry season/winter-dry**
	- Incorporated vegetation and soils
	- Does not consider winds, temperature extremes, precipitation intensity, quantity of sunshine, cloud cover, or net radiation
	- But, correlations with the actual world are "reasonable", and input data are standardized and available

### World Climate Classification
- **Organized according to source regions of air masses**

### Latitude Zones
- **Arctic:** 66.5 degrees N to North Pole
- **Subarctic:** 55 degrees N to 66.5 degrees N
- **Midlatitude:** 35 degrees N to 55 degrees N
- **Subtropical:** 23.5 degrees N to 35 degrees N
- **Equatorial and tropical:** 23.5 degrees N to 23.5 degrees S
- **Southern hemisphere:** same but South

### Climographs
- A graphical representation of a given location
- Combines a line graph of mean monthly temperature, and a bar graph of total monthly precipitation
- Useful for comparing different locations around the world

# Six Basic Climate Categories (After Koppen)
1. **Tropical** (tropical latitudes, winterless)
		- Found in the "tropics"
		- Influence of the ITCZ
		- 12 months of 18 degrees C temperatures
		- After Koppen:
			- Tropical rainforest (Af)
			- Tropical monsoonal (Am)
			- Tropical savanna (Aw)
2. **Mesothermal** (midlatitudes, mild winters)
	- Winters without sustained snow cover; summer warm near coasts, warmer-hot inland
3. **Microthermal** (mid-high latitudes, cold winters)
4. **Polar** (high latitudes and polar regions)
	- Extremely cold winters, cool summers
	- Cover ~20% of Earth's surface
	- Permanent ice sheets often a common characteristic
	- Very dry, as cold descending air contains little moisture
5. **Highland** (high elevations at all latitudes)
	- High, mountainous areas around the world
	- Attributes vary with elevation
6. **Dry** (permanent moisture deficits at all latitudes)
	- Arid: 10-30 cm of precipitation annually
	- Semi-arid: can support grasslands
	- Both show large daily and seasonal temperature variation

# Review of Earth's Climate System
- **Climate** = collection pattern of weather over many years
- **Climatology** = study of Earth's climate and its variability, long-term weather patterns over time, the controls that produce Earth's climate conditions
- **Climate regions** = areas with similarity in weather statistics
- **Classification** = ordering or grouping of data or phenomena into categories; includes transition zones (areas of gradual change)
- **Genetic vs. empirical classification schemes** = former looks at causative factors (Ex: interaction of air masses), latter uses statistics
- **Climograph** = shows monthly temperature and precipitation for a particular weather station at a particular city
