# GEOG272 - Week 13: Climate Change

# Indications of Change
- Global temperature trends
	- Observed air temperatures are **increasing** over time
- Permafrost and methane hydrates
- The Keeling Curve: carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa
	- **Charles Keeling (1928-2005)**: "Using rigorous analytical procedures, he revealed new information about natural and man-caused carbon trends. The precision, accuracy, and continuity of Keeling's research over the span of decades provided one of the most important scientific linkages between fossil fuel combustion and global climate change due to the greenhouse effect"
- GHG emissions, ice melt, sea-level rise, extreme events
- How the world will feel the heat

# The Keeling Curve
- **Charles Keeling (1928-2005)**
- The Keeling Curve: carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa

> "Using rigorous analytical procedures, he revealed new information about natural and man-caused carbon trends. The precision, accuracy, and continuity of Keeling's research over the span of decades provided one of the most important scientific linkages between fossil fuel combustion and global climate change due to the greenhouse effect"

## Preceding Keeling: Fourier & Arrhenius
- The concept of the greenhouse effect was first proposed in the 1820's by the French mathematician and physicist **Joseph Fourier (1768-1830)**
- Fourier's calculations showed that the Earth should by much cooler that it is, given the amount of energy, it receives from the sun
- One explanation he proposed was that the Earth's atmosphere might provide an insulating effect, retaining some of the heat that would otherwise be reemitted into space
- Fourier's proposal is considered the earliest hypothesis tied to the greenhouse effect

- Over the next 50 years, scientists debated whether the rapid emission of CO2 resulted from fossil fuel combustion tied to industrialization could eventually lead to a small increase in global temperatures, or whether natural physical processes, such as the absorption of CO2 by the oceans, would easily negate any such increases
- **Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927)** first proposed the fossil fuel contribution in 1896
- This remains our central thesis for why we face the global warming challenge here in the 21st century

## The Manometer
- Keeling began taking air and water samples in the Western USA
- A specially constructed instrument, a gas manometer, was designed to control for temperature, pressure, and volume, down to a precision of 0.1% (much more precise than any previous device)
- Keeling noted that CO2 concentrations increased at night and decreased during the day, with nearly constant afternoon concentration of 310 ppm regardless of location
- These results contrasted with earlier published research that estimated much greater variability, ranging from 150 to 350 ppm

- **Latest CO2 reading March 26, 2019:** 410.59 ppm

## To the Big Island of Hawaii
- In March 1958, an analyzer was installed at the weather bureau's Mauna Loa Observatory (on the remote north slope of the Mauna Loa volcano), an "ideal location for collecting pristine air far from human influences"
- The first reading from Mauna Loa, dated March 29, 1958, measured the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 313 ppm

# A Tipping Point Methodology
- **Abstract:** "The term 'tipping point' commonly refers to a critical threshold at which a tiny perturbation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system"
	- Here we introduce the term "tipping element" to describe large-scale components of the Earth system that may pass a tipping point
- "We critically evaluate a potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system under anthropogenic forcing, drawing on the pertinent literature and a recent international workshop to compile a short list, and we asses where their tipping points lie"

# Arctic Sea-Ice
- As sea-ice melts, it exposes a much darker ocean surface, which absorbs more radiation and amplifies the warming
- Energy-balance model suggest that this **ice-albedo positive feedback** can give rise to multiple stable states of sea-ice (and land snow) cover, including finite ice cap and ice-free states, with ice caps smaller than a certain size being unstable

- **Permafrost** soils now warming faster than Arctic air temperatures, releasing "ancient" carbon; an **"immediate" concern** related to climate change

- **Methane hydrates** = a gas hydrate, stored deep beneath permafrost deposits on land and in offshore deposits on the ocean floor; exist in cold temperatures and under high pressure within sedimentary rock
	- Methane molecules encased in ice, becoming destabilized with warming temperatures; melting breaks down the crystalline hydrate structure, releasing a "burst" of methane into atmosphere or ocean
	- A potential source of energy; estimates of ~10,000 Gt of methane trapped in gas hydrate worldwide (more than other fossil fuel reserves combines)
	- Melting 1 cubic meter of hydrate release ~160 cubic meters of methane gas
	- Fear of destabilization of substrate, and the release of larger quantities of methane. Or release as a by-product of energy extraction

## Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS)
- Ice-sheet models typically exhibit multiple stable states and nonlinear transitions between them. In some situation with the GIS removed, summer melting prevents its reestablishment, indicating bistability, although others disagree
	- Regardless of whether there is bistability in deglaciation, warming at the periphery lowers ice altitude, increasing surface temperature and causing a **positive feedback loop** that is expected to exhibit a critical threshold beyond which there is **ongoing net mass loss and the GIS shrinks radically or eventually disappears**

## West Atlantic Ice Sheet (WAIS)
- Most of the WAIS is grounded below sea level and has the potential to collapse if grounding-line retreat triggers **a strong positive feedback loop whereby ocean water undercuts the ice sheet and triggers further separation from the bedrock**

## Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation (THC)
- **A shutoff in North Atlantic Deep Water formation** and the associated Atlantic THC can occur **if sufficient freshwater and/or heat enters the North Atlantic** to halt density-driven North Atlantic Deep Water formation

## Destabilization of Ocean Waters
- Sea level is rising, sea ice is melting, and ice shelves and glaciers are destabilizing. Ocean warming is also dramatically affecting marine biochemistry, with increases in de-oxygenated dead zones and ocean acidification
- As a heat and carbon reservoir for the world, the ocean has been a reliable buffer, largely shielding us from the worst effects of global warming. But this buffering capacity is not unlimited, and the warming may fundamentally alter our planet by disrupting how the ocean circulates
