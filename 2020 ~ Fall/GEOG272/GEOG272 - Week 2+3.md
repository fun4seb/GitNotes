# GEOG272 - Week 2+3: The Earth's Modern Atmosphere
> Atmosphere = surrounding environment or influence; "Atmos" = Greek for vapor/air

- A **thin** blanket of a mixture of gases surrounding the planet, **held close to the Earth's surface by gravity**

# Earth's Atmosphere Summarized: Evolution, Composition, Structure, Function
- **Evolution:** the atmosphere is dynamic and continually evolving
- **Composition:** major fixed and variable gases, aerosols
- **Structure & temperature:** troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere
- **Functional layers:** homosphere, heterosphere, ionosphere, ozone layer, greenhouse layer

# Evolution of Earth's Atmosphere
- Today is possible the 4th general atmosphere in Earth's history

- **4 billion years ago:**
	- **Atmosphere was deadly to all life but algae and bacteria**
	- Primordial atmosphere of **hydrogen**, with some **helium** and traces of ammonia and methane, eventually leaks off into space (allowing for a less deadly atmosphere to develop)
		- These gases are extremely light and try to float off into space rather than sinking down into the earth gravity
	- Later, release **(outgassing)** of carbon dioxide, sulphuric gases, nitrogen, and water vapor trapped within Earth's interior
		- **Today we still experience this process through on-going volcanic activity**

- **2.2 billion years ago:**
	- Early ocean life evolved, bacteria began process of **photosynthesis**, finally **converting carbon dioxide to oxygen**, which became "significant", but unstable in the atmosphere. Atmosphere was still high in sulfuric gases, low in nitrogen
	- As a result there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, **leading to cooler temperatures worldwide** (slight change in temperature can have a large effect)
	- As the Earth cooled, **vapor condensed to form clouds and rain**. Oceans formed and grew, nitrogen increased; **still no stable supply of oxygen**
	- Cooling > condensation > somewhat acidic conditions

- **600 million years ago:**
	- Oxygen levels further increasing
		- As oxygen increased, carbon dioxide decreased; oxygen molecules absorbed sunlight forming the ozone, **shielding subsequent life on the planet from UV radiation**

- **540 million years ago:**
	- **Carbonate skeleton-building organisms** begin to absorb carbon dioxide from sea water

- **300 million years ago:**
	- Emergence of **shell-forming plankton** (planktonic calcifers)
	- Ocean levels fell, exposing continental shelves

## A New Atmosphere
- Free-floating organisms in the oceans **cycled carbon through their bodies, into ocean sediments**, causing oceans to draw greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere resulting in a more moderate physical atmosphere
- Growth and death of **terrestrial forests**:
	- Forests absorb more sunlight, producing more water vapor = influence capacity to regulate atmospheric temperature = decomposition = **coal/oil ("Carboniferous period")**
- **The carbon cycle:** The extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis allowed carbon to be deposited into the Earth, leading to coal and oil reserves; later returned to the atmosphere through natural fires completing the cycle
- All this contributed to a changing atmosphere eventually dominated by **nitrogen (from the geosphere)** & **oxygen (from the biosphere)**

# Gas
- **Relevant vocabulary:**
	- **Atom** = basic unit of a chemical element
	- **Molecule** = group of atoms bonded together
	- **Gas** = a "cloud" of individual atoms with **very weak attractive forces**, compared to a liquid or solid (outer shells are completely filled with electrons)
	- **Inert gas** = a gas that is **relatively** non-reactive with other substances a due to **few** open electron slots; **(inert = non-reactive)**
	- **Noble gas** = a gas that is **completely** non-reactive with other substances due to no open electron slots **(noble = completely non-reactive)**

## The Physics of a Gas
- Heating a has causes it to occupy a greater volume, with particles vibrating more rapidly, spreading over more space
- If in a container, gas exerts increased pressure against the walls, where pressure exerted by a gas is the sum total of the impact of the particles composing it
- **^Temperature = ^Vibration = ^# of force impacts**

> Kinetic Energy ~ The energy of motion, the vibrational energy we measure as temperature

> Temperature ~ The measure of the average kinetic energy of individual molecules in matter

> Heat ~ The flow of kinetic energy from one body to another, resulting in a temperature difference between them; depends upon density or mass of substance/body

### "Mean Free Path" of a Gas Molecule
> Mean Free Path ~ The distance a particle must travel before a collision with another particle (molecules collide and change direction)

- A cmÂ³ of air consists of some 30 x 10^15 molecules (of gases)
- The average speed of a nitrogen (N2) molecule is about 500 m/second
- Each molecules goes on the average 5.9 x 10^-5 m until it approaches another molecules and is repelled by it; **all molecules travel a certain average distance before they inevitably come into contact with another**, this distance of unobstructed runway for each molecule is called the **" mean free path"**

- **Variables in mean free path calculations:**
	- Viscosity, density, pressure of air, size of molecule

- Heat is **created** when kinetic energy is transferred between molecules (between bodies)

- **Altitude and mean free path:** (altitude = mean free path; distance before hitting another molecule)
	- 300 km = 20 km mean free path
	- 250 km = 1 km
	- 150 km = 10 m
	- 100 km = 16 km
	- Sea level = 0.1 micrometers

# Composition of Air
- Gases in the atmosphere are either **Fixed or variable**
	- **Fixed gases** = gases that are fixed (relatively) in amount around the planet
		- Ex: Nitrogen & Oxygen
	-  **Variable gases** - gases that vary in amount from place to place and are not uniform over the whole Earth
		- Ex: Water vapor, ozone
		- **Today**, carbon dioxide may also be considered a **variable gas** (usually measured in parts per million) due to its variable growth over time; **no longer constant**

- In the early atmosphere, **elemental contributors included:**
	- Hydrogen, helium, ammonia, methane, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
- Later (after the outgassing of elements from the early atmosphere), **fixed gases nitrogen & oxygen** predominated, along with smaller amounts of other elements
	- **Water vapor** is an important contributor, but considered a **variable gas** due to its many forms and locations around the planet, depending upon latitude and presence of water bodies

## Atmospheric Gases by %
- **Nitrogen:** 78.1%
- **Oxygen:** 20.9%
- **Argon:** 0.9%
- **Other:** remaining 0.1%

- Earth is a **nitrogen dominated atmosphere**

# Functional Spheres: Homosphere & Heterosphere
![](https://images.slideplayer.com/1/230655/slides/slide_6.jpg "Homosphere & Heterosphere")

- Note the **temperature profile**; see how the temperature within the layers either rises or falls with an increase in altitude (troposphere gets **colder as altitude climbs** while the stratosphere gets **warmer as the altitude climbs**) 

- Component gases are **layered**
	- Diffuse boundaries between layers
	- **Turbopause** = boundary/edge of a layer
- **Turbulence mixes component gases** = more homogeneous
- Component gases are spatially uniform (fixed gases) with the exception of **water vapor and ozone** (variable gases)

- **Heterosphere layers:**
	- Exosphere ("outer sphere")
	- Heterosphere ("changing sphere")
	- Thermosphere ("heat sphere")
	- Ionosphere/Magnetosphere

- **Homosphere layers:**
	- Homosphere ("same sphere")
	- Mesosphere ("middle sphere")
	- Stratosphere ("stratified sphere")
	- Ozonosphere ("ozone layer")
	- Troposphere ("turning/mixing sphere")

> (Zone)pause = upper boundary of that particular zone before entering the next; Ex: Mesopause of the mesosphere before entering the thermosphere, thermopause of the thermosphere before entering space

## Thermosphere: 80-480 km
- **Thermopause** = upper boundary of thermosphere before entering space **(edge of atmosphere)**

- "Heat sphere", where temperature rises sharply with altitude; heat output however is minimally due to such **low pressure/density of molecules**
- Absorption of gamma rays, X-rays, and shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation

## Mesosphere: 50-80 km
- **Mesopause** = upper boundary of mesosphere before entering the thermosphere

- Averages -90 degrees
	- **lower air temperature with higher altitude**
- Low pressure/density of molecules due to altitude
- **Noctilucnent clouds (NLCs)** in upper mesosphere = cosmic or meteoric dust particles, acting as a nuclei around which ice crystals form

## Stratosphere: 18-50 km
- **Stratopause** = upper boundary of stratosphere before entering mesosphere

- Higher air temperature with higher altitude, from -57 degrees at 18 km to about 0 degrees at stratopause
- ~19.9% of total mass of atmosphere
- Utilized by aircrafts to take advantage of strong persistent winds
- Little mixing occurring with troposphere due to **tropospheric "lid"**
- As greenhouse gases increase in the troposphere, **the stratosphere cools**
- Contains the **ozone layer**

# The Ozone Layer (Ozonosphere)
- A naturally-occurring layer in the **upper stratosphere**
- **Absorbs ~99% of incoming UV**
- In **dynamic equilibrium** before 1930
- Concentration of atmospheric ozone is indicated in **Dobson units**

## Formation of Ozone
![](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/711x323/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/startswithabang/files/2018/01/make_ozone.jpg?width=960 "Ozone Production")

> Photodissociation ~ Breakdown of compounds due to exposure to UV light (insolation), releasing the previously binded components

- **Photodissociation** = Breakdown of oxygen molecules due to **insolation**; leads to **creation of oxygen atoms**
	- Oxygen atoms created during this process later **recombine with other oxygen molecules to create ozone**

## Breakdown of Ozone
- Human-produced compounds are broken down by UV radiation in the stratosphere, they then seek molecular balance by **"stealing" an oxygen atom from an ozone molecule** (destroying the ozone molecule)
	- Ex: Nitrogen will create nitrogen oxide, chlorine will create chlorine oxide
- Thus the ozone is destroyed by reactions with **chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen gases**

- **Important compounds that contribute to this process:**
	- Methane
	- Chlorofluorocarbons
	- Nitrous oxide

## Polar Stratospheric Clouds
- Ozone-depleted substances are transported great distances by atmospheric air motions
- The severe depletion of the **Antarctic** ozone layer known as the **"ozone hole"** occurs because of the special atmospheric and chemical condition that exist there
- The very low winter temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere cause **polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)** to form
- Special reactions that occur on PSCs, combined with the relative isolation of polar stratospheric air, allow chlorine and bromine reactions to produce the ozone hole in Antarctic springtime

# Catalytic Reactions / Social Reactions
> Catalytic Reaction Cycle ~ Chain of chemical reactions which result in the destruction of many ozone molecules **while the molecule that started the reaction is reformed to continue the process**; cyclical

- Because of catalytic reactions, **an individual chlorine atom on average destroys nearly a thousand ozone molecules before it is converted into a form that is harmless to ozone**
- Aerosols and clouds can **accelerate ozone loss** through reactions on cloud surfaces

# Ionosphere: 50-1000 km
- Absorbs cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, and UV-C -> removal of electrons from atoms and molecules, which become positively charged (electrons are negatively charged) = **ionization**
- 3 subregions: F, E, and D
- Influences radio broadcasts and satellite communication

> Blue jets & Red Sprites ~ Electrical discharges above active thunderstorms in the ionosphere

- Radio waves can be **bounced** off the ionosphere to send them large distances

# Magnetosphere
- The **region of space that surrounds the Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth** (rather than the magnetic field of space)
- The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field

# Spectrum of Shortwave Energy
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1095/2016/11/03155014/OSC_Astro_05_02_Radiation2.jpg "Wavelength Spectrum")

- Some wavelengths are absorbed or reflected within various levels in the atmosphere

# Troposphere: 0-18 km
- **"Tropo"** = ancient Greek for "turn", "turn toward", "change"; often associated with weather
- **Where practically all weather phenomena occurs**
- Contains **~80% of all atmospheric gases**
	- Bottom third (4 km) **contains half of all gases in the atmosphere**, and is the **only breathable layer**

- Temperature gradient is **"upside down"** (warmest part at the bottom)
	- moving upwards the temperature cools by 6.5 degrees Celsius/vertical km traveled = **lapse rate**

> Lapse Rate ~ Rate of temperature decrease with altitude

## Weather & Water Vapor
- **Mixing** accounts for why the warmer air rises to the top (as opposed to solar energy being responsible for this)
- **Most water vapor is found in the troposphere**, but varies with altitude and latitude (the higher the altitude and latitude, the lower the water vapor content)

## The Tropopause
- **Tropopause** = upper boundary of troposphere before entering stratosphere

- Acts as a **"lid"**, keeping cooler air from mixing with warmer air in stratosphere
	- This "lid" is what stops clouds from rising into stratosphere, they rise to the top of troposphere and disperse as they reach the tropopause
- Average temperature of **-57 degrees Celsius** at tropopause
- ~18 km @ equator, 12 km @ mid-latitude, 8 km over the poles

# Atmospheric Pressure
- **Weight of atmosphere = atmospheric pressure**
	- The lower you are in the atmosphere the greater amount of atmosphere that rests above you, and therefor greater pressure; **lower = higher pressure**
	- Imagine all of Earth's atmosphere as a tank of water, the deeper in the water you go the more water that is above you weighing you down, thus creating a greater pressure

- **Sea-level atmospheric pressure = 1013.2 mb (millibars)**

- **Higher altitude = lower atmospheric density, mass of atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure**

- Compression of the Atmosphere is due to **Gravity**; causes the compression of air molecules in the atmosphere
