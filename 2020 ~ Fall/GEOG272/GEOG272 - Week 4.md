# GEOG272 - Week 4: Energy Balances & Global Temperatures

# Contrails & Climate Change
- **Condensation trails (contrails)** are the trails of exhaust left behind by **planes** that form the familiar streaks of clouds sometimes seen in the sky
	- Hot and humid exhaust from jet engines mixes with cold air in the atmosphere, where the water vapor in the exhaust freezes, producing white trails

- Jet engine exhaust contains **carbon dioxide, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, unburned fuel, soot and metal particles, as well as water vapor**. The soot provides condensation sites for the water vapor and any particles present in the air provide additional sites

- **Anatomy of a Contrail:**
	- Contrails form as moisture in the air condenses and freezes around soot particles in jet engine exhaust
	- In certain conditions, contrails can spread and merge, forming thin **cirrus clouds** covering thousands of square miles. They can persist for hours and **warm the atmosphere**

# Earth's Radiation Budget
- **Reflected shortwave radiation (Earth's albedo):** highest values occur over **cloudy and snowy regions**, while the lowest values occur over **oceans**
- **Outgoing longwave radiation**: highest values occur over **deserts** (found along the equator), while the lowest values occur over the **polar regions**

## Energy Budget by Latitude
- **Tropic of Cancer** is located **23.5 degrees** North of the equator, **Tropic of Capricorn** is located **23.5 degrees** South of the equator

- Surplus energy is located between the tropics along the equator and deficit energy is located towards the poles
- Energy is **transferred from lower latitude energy surplus areas (equator) to higher latitude energy deficit areas (poles)** by **atmospheric circulation**
	- If there was no atmospheric circulation, lower latitudes would get hotter and hotter and higher latitudes colder and colder

## Daily Radiation and Temperature Curves: "Lag"

# Heat and Methods of Transfer
- **Heat** = the flow of kinetic energy between molecules and from one body or substance to another, resulting in a change in temperature
- Heat flow stops when temperatures (amount of kinetic energy) are equal

- **Types of heat:**
	- **Sensible** = energy that changes the temperature of a substance; can be measured with a thermometer and "sensed" by humans as temperature (molecular motion due to kinetic energy)
		- The **"greenhouse effect"** is an example of radiation converted into sensible heat
	- **Latent** = energy absorbed or released from a substance during a change in state such as when water evaporates into vapor; cannot be measured with a thermometer
		- When a substance **warms** to change state latent energy is **absorbed** (Ex: ice to water to vapor), when a substance **cools** to change states latent energy is **released** (Ex: vapor to water to ice)

- **Types of heat transfer:**
	- **Radiation** =
	- **Conduction** = 
	- **Convection** = 
	- **Advection** =
