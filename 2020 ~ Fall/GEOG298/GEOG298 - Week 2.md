# Module 1: Systems Thinking

## Understanding Systems Thinking
- Failing solutions to complex problems tend to share the following characteristics:
	- They address symptoms rather than the underlying problem
	- They seem obvious (and often succeed in the short term)
	- They achieve short-term gains that are undermined by longer-term impacts
	- They produce negative unintended consequences
	- They lead us to assume that we are not responsible for the problem’s recurrence

- **Gregory Bateson**: British scholar that helped extend systems theory to the social and behavioral sciences in the 1940s
	- Believed that **all things were connected**, nothing that is independent of the whole and it is crucial to take this into account when addressing **complex problems**; interested in the larger patterns that govern the nature of the world

## What is a System?
> System = a set of parts/elements that form a whole

- Systems exist within an **environment** and have a boundary which differentiates between a systems **exterior and interior**
- Systems can be **open** or **closed**
	- A closed system requires no input/energy from outside, which is rare outside the world of chemistry and thermodynamics; **it does not interact with its environment and has no influence nor is influenced**
	-	**Most systems are open**,  they require, and are constantly influenced by, input/energy from the outside environment and also produce some output which affects the broader environment around them **(this cycle of input and output is what leads to feedback loops)**

### Feedback Loops
- Positive or negative feedback loops regulate system outputs
	- A positive feedback loop produces **more of the same action**
	- A negative feedback loop produces **less of the same action** (inverse relationship)
- **Negative feedback is a form of self-regulation** that typically generates very stable systems, whereas **positive feedback loops often have destabilizing effects** since a small event can cascade through the system like ripples in water

- Systems tend to oscillate in response to feedback loops. They can be relatively stable, then volatile, then self-regulate and become stable again.
	- This is understood as a **"dynamic stability"** rather than a static one.

## Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
> Complex Adaptive System ~ A system in comprised of many individual agents

- Systems can either be **simple** or **complex**
	- In a simple system, interactions between components are linear and predictable, as is the overall behavior of the system. **Simple systems are therefore often called deterministic systems**
	- A complicated system has many connected parts, **but the components never change**, they always act the same and the way the system responds to the external environment is linear and predictable; a more complicated version of a simple system (Ex: a bicycle with multiple gears)
	
- In a CAS however, **the connections are critical, but individual components (called agents) are not** and the system can lose some components without being affected. **The system is not predictable** even if we can predict the output of individual components
	- Agents are independent, interact with one another and they can change. They can make and break connections with other components and new agents can enter the system (Ex: through reproduction)

- **Some examples of CAS:**
	- Stock markets
	- Insect colonies
	- The brain, immune system, etc.
	- The internet
	- Biosphere and ecosystems

## Special Properties of CAS: Self Organizing
> Self-Organizing = Self Regulating = Ability to heal when confronted with change

- Change in CAS is **non-linear**, meaning the outcomes of interactions in the system are therefore **impossible to predict**, even if one can make educated guesses about how system components will behave

> Path Dependency ~ Consequence of non-linearity; It refers to the fact that the local rules of interaction change as the system evolves and develops. The outcomes of interactions between a system’s parts will be shaped by their initial state and by the disturbances they have undergone and these, in turn, will to some degree determine future available options; **path dependency merely suggests that an awareness of past actions will help us understand the present situation and can help us see a way forward**

- Non-linearity and path dependency result in the existence of **alternative stable states** in system development, or variations in the CAS’ function, structure, and feedbacks. 
	- Shocks and disturbances can drive CAS across a **threshold** or **tipping point** into a different state. This process is known as a **regime shift** and is often accompanied by undesirable outcomes

- CAS are **self-organizing**; there is no single centralized control mechanism that governs them. Control is wholly decentralized or distributed over all the components of the system. As individual components continuously adapt to changing conditions, the system can also maintain and repair itself
	- Self-organizing leads to **emergent properties**

#### Emergent Properties
> Emergent Properties ~ **Properties and capabilities specific to a system as a whole as a result of interactions between smaller components working together** rather than properties that can be derived from any one of a systems components individually; A system is more than the sum of its parts

- Examples of self-organizing emergent properties from the natural world include the schooling of fish and flocks of birds
	- There is no unified leader **(global controller)** and each smaller component is acting individually with feedback from interactions with other components to accomplish tasks as a system that could not be accomplished individually

#### Resilience
- The extent to which a system can adapt while **maintaining its fundamental functions** is referred to as **resilience**; **"How much can something change before it loses its identity/fundamental qualities"**

> Resilience ~ "The magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed or accommodated before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control system behavior"

- A CAS that is allowed to self-organize is likely to be more resilient than one that is forced to remain in a very specific, rigid state; **the ability of a system to self-organize = ability to "heal" itself**

- Resilience vs. resistance; **(not the same)**
	- Resistance is the ability for a system to remain **unchanged** when being subjected to a disturbance or disturbances
	- Resilience is the ability and rate of a system to **recover** from a disturbance and return to its pre-disturbed state.
	- **Resistance is the ability to stop any change**, while **resiliance is the ability to bounce back from change**

- **"Ball in a basin" metaphor** for resilience (the slopes of a basin which have a natural pull to a central point i.e. stable state. It takes a large force to push the ball over the top of the slope **(threshold of a system)** and into another basin **(regime shift)** , otherwise the ball will always return to a steady state at the bottom of the basin)
