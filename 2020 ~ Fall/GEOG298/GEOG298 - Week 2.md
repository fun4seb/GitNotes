# Module 1: Systems Thinking

## Understanding Systems Thinking
- Failing solutions to complex problems tend to share the following characteristics:
	- They address symptoms rather than the underlying problem
	- They seem obvious (and often succeed in the short term)
	- They achieve short-term gains that are undermined by longer-term impacts
	- They produce negative unintended consequences
	- They lead us to assume that we are not responsible for the problemâ€™s recurrence

- **Gregory Bateson**: British scholar that helped extend systems theory to the social and behavioral sciences in the 1940s
	- Believed that **all things were connected**, nothing that is idependent of the whole and it is crucial to take this into account when addressing **complex problems**; interested in the larger patterns that govern the nature of the world
