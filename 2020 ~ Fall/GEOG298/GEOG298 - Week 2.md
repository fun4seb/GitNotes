# Module 1: Systems Thinking

## Understanding Systems Thinking
- Failing solutions to complex problems tend to share the following characteristics:
	- They address symptoms rather than the underlying problem
	- They seem obvious (and often succeed in the short term)
	- They achieve short-term gains that are undermined by longer-term impacts
	- They produce negative unintended consequences
	- They lead us to assume that we are not responsible for the problemâ€™s recurrence

- **Gregory Bateson**: British scholar that helped extend systems theory to the social and behavioral sciences in the 1940s
	- Believed that **all things were connected**, nothing that is independent of the whole and it is crucial to take this into account when addressing **complex problems**; interested in the larger patterns that govern the nature of the world

## What is a System?
> System = a set of parts/elements that form a whole

- Systems exist within an **environment** and have a boundary which differentiates between a systems **exterior and interior**
- Systems can be **open** or **closed**
	- A closed system requires no input/energy from outside, which is rare outside the world of chemistry and thermodynamics; **it does not interact with its environment and has no influence nor is influenced**
	-	**Most systems are open**,  they require, and are constantly influenced by, input/energy from the outside environment and also produce some output which affects the broader environment around them **(this cycle of input and output is what leads to feedback loops)**

### Feedback Loops
- Positive or negative feedback loops regulate system outputs
	- A positive feedback loop produces **more of the same action**
	- A negative feedback loop produces **less of the same action** (inverse relationship)
- **Negative feedback is a form of self-regulation** that typically generates very stable systems, whereas **positive feedback loops often have destabilizing effects** since a small event can cascade through the system like ripples in water
- Systems tend to oscillate in response to feedback loops. They can be relatively stable, then volatile, then self-regulate and become stable again.
	- This is understood as a **"dynamic stability"** rather than a static one.

### Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
- Systems can either be **simple** or **complex**
	- In a simple system, interactions between components are linear and predictable, as is the overall behavior of the system. **Simple systems are therefore often called deterministic systems**
	- A complicated system has many connected parts, **but the components never change**, they always act the same and the way the system responds to the external environment is linear and predictable. It is really just a more complicated version of a simple system (Ex: a bicycle with multiple gears)
	- In a CAS, however, **the connections are critical, but individual components (called agents) are not** and the system can lose some components without being affected.
		- Agents are independent, interact with one another and they can change. They can make and break connections with other components and new agents can enter the system (Ex: through reproduction)
