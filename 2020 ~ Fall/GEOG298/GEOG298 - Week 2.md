# Module 1: Systems Thinking

## Understanding Systems Thinking
- Failing solutions to complex problems tend to share the following characteristics:
	- They address symptoms rather than the underlying problem
	- They seem obvious (and often succeed in the short term)
	- They achieve short-term gains that are undermined by longer-term impacts
	- They produce negative unintended consequences
	- They lead us to assume that we are not responsible for the problem’s recurrence

- **Gregory Bateson**: British scholar that helped extend systems theory to the social and behavioral sciences in the 1940s
	- Believed that **all things were connected**, nothing that is independent of the whole and it is crucial to take this into account when addressing **complex problems**; interested in the larger patterns that govern the nature of the world

## What is a System?
> System = a set of parts/elements that form a whole

- Systems exist within an **environment** and have a boundary which differentiates between a systems **exterior and interior**
- Systems can be **open** or **closed**
	- A closed system requires no input/energy from outside, which is rare outside the world of chemistry and thermodynamics; **it does not interact with its environment and has no influence nor is influenced**
	-	**Most systems are open**,  they require, and are constantly influenced by, input/energy from the outside environment and also produce some output which affects the broader environment around them **(this cycle of input and output is what leads to feedback loops)**

### Feedback Loops
- Positive or negative feedback loops regulate system outputs
	- A positive feedback loop produces **more of the same action**
	- A negative feedback loop produces **less of the same action** (inverse relationship)
- **Negative feedback is a form of self-regulation** that typically generates very stable systems, whereas **positive feedback loops often have destabilizing effects** since a small event can cascade through the system like ripples in water

- Systems tend to oscillate in response to feedback loops. They can be relatively stable, then volatile, then self-regulate and become stable again.
	- This is understood as a **"dynamic stability"** rather than a static one.

## Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
> Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) ~ Self-organizing (decentralized control), leading to emergent properties (new patterns emerge over time).

- Systems can either be **simple** or **complex**
	- In a simple system, interactions between components are linear and predictable, as is the overall behavior of the system. **Simple systems are therefore often called deterministic systems**
	- A complicated system has many connected parts, **but the components never change**, they always act the same and the way the system responds to the external environment is linear and predictable; a more complicated version of a simple system (Ex: a bicycle with multiple gears)
	
- In a CAS however, **the connections are critical, but individual components (called agents) are not** and the system can lose some components without being affected. **The system is not predictable** even if we can predict the output of individual components
	- Agents are independent, interact with one another and they can change. They can make and break connections with other components and new agents can enter the system (Ex: through reproduction)

- **Some examples of CAS:**
	- Stock markets
	- Insect colonies
	- The brain, immune system, etc.
	- The internet
	- Biosphere and ecosystems

## Special Properties of CAS: Self Organizing
> Self-Organizing = Self Regulating = Ability to heal when confronted with change

- Change in CAS is **non-linear**, meaning the outcomes of interactions in the system are therefore **impossible to predict**, even if one can make educated guesses about how system components will behave

> Non-Linearity ~ Inability to predict outcome (many potential paths)

> Path Dependency ~ Consequence of non-linearity; It refers to the fact that the local rules of interaction change as the system evolves and develops. The outcomes of interactions between a system’s parts will be shaped by their initial state and by the disturbances they have undergone and these, in turn, will to some degree determine future available options; **path dependency merely suggests that an awareness of past actions will help us understand the present situation and can help us see a way forward**

- Non-linearity and path dependency result in the existence of **alternative stable states** in system development, or variations in the CAS’ function, structure, and feedbacks. 
	- Shocks and disturbances can drive a CAS over a **threshold/tipping point** into a different state. This process is known as a **regime shift** and is often accompanied by undesirable outcomes

> Alternative Stable States ~ Variations, where local rules of interaction change as system evolves and develops 

> Regime Shift ~ A move from one state of being to another

- CAS are **self-organizing**; there is no single centralized control mechanism that governs them. Control is wholly decentralized or distributed over all the components of the system. As individual components continuously adapt to changing conditions, the system can also maintain and repair itself
	- Self-organizing leads to **emergent properties**

### Emergent Properties
> Emergent Properties ~ **Properties and capabilities specific to a system as a whole as a result of interactions between smaller components working together** rather than properties that can be derived from any one of a systems components individually; A system is more than the sum of its parts

- Examples of self-organizing emergent properties from the natural world include the schooling of fish and flocks of birds
	- There is no unified leader **(global controller)** and each smaller component is acting individually with feedback from interactions with other components to accomplish tasks as a system that could not be accomplished individually

### Resilience
- The extent to which a system can adapt while **maintaining its fundamental functions** is referred to as **resilience**; **"How much can something change before it loses its identity/fundamental qualities"**

> Resilience ~ "The magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed or accommodated before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control system behavior"

- A CAS that is allowed to self-organize is likely to be more resilient than one that is forced to remain in a very specific, rigid state; **the ability of a system to self-organize = ability to "heal" itself**

- Resilience vs. resistance; **(not the same)**
	- Resistance is the ability for a system to remain **unchanged** when being subjected to a disturbance or disturbances
	- Resilience is the ability and rate of a system to **recover** from a disturbance and return to its pre-disturbed state.
	- **Resistance is the ability to stop any change**, while **resiliance is the ability to bounce back from change**

- **"Ball in a basin" metaphor** for resilience (the slopes of a basin which have a natural pull to a central point i.e. stable state. It takes a large force to push the ball over the top of the slope **(threshold of a system)** and into another basin **(regime shift)** , otherwise the ball will always return to a steady state at the bottom of the basin)

## What is a Wicked Problem?
- A wicked problem is one **“with no definitive formulation, no stopping rule, and no test for a solution”**, one that cannot be separated from issues of values, equity and social justice.
	- Wicked problems have lots of history and layers of social complexity, but no easy answers, and **they demand dynamic, interlinked solutions**
- **Reductionist approaches** will not work to fix complex systems or solve wicked problems; **a systems thinking approach is necessary**

### Rittel and Weber’s Description of Wicked Problems
1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem
2. Wicked problems have no "stopping rule"
3. Solutions to wicked problems are not "true or false" but "good or bad"
4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem
5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one shot operation", because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error
6. Wicked problems do not have a definitive set of solution, nor is there a rule to determine what solutions are "appropriate"
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique
8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem
9. Conflicting evidence can be explained in many different ways
10. The decision maker has no right to be wrong

## Dealing with Wicked Problems
- Management of complex systems must be:
	1. **Adaptive**
	2. Flexible
	3. Able to deal with uncertainty and surprise
	4. Experimental at scales compatible with the scales of system functions

- **Adaptive management** is a framework that meets these requirements and is key in addressing wicked problems

### Adaptive Management
> Adaptive Management ~ A systematic process for continually adjusting policies and practices by learning from the outcome of previously used policies and practices

- Adaptive management is a process that essentially recognizes uncertainty, monitors system responses to interventions and anticipates that future management interventions will be modified as we learn more about the system and problem; **iterative process of "learning by doing"**
	- **“adaptive management is about urgency, acting without knowing enough, and learning”**

### Using Alternative Sources of Knowledge
- Because of the complexity of systems, we must consider all forms of knowledge to address wicked problems. This includes **utilizing different disciplines within Western science** as well as more **alternative knowledge that may be based on different worldviews**
	- Ex: Consulting indigenous people for their holistic cultural knowledge of their environment, or comparing the perspectives a variety of academic disciplines

- **Local Knowledge:** Refers to a set of knowledge and practices of more recent resource management systems. It is a cumulative body of knowledge applied and developed by actors in a local context.

- **Traditional Knowledge:** More broadly defined and refers to the **local knowledge held by indigenous peoples or local knowledge unique to a given culture or society**; "the umbrella of traditional knowledge" 
	- Knowledge that is collected over generations and is culturally transmitted as opposed to book-learned
	- Knowledge is not limited to ecological topics

- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK):** “a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural transmission about the relationships of living beings (including humans) with one another and the **environment**”
	- **Area of traditional knowledge specifically related to ecological information about ones environment**
	- TEK is **cumulative and dynamic**; iterated over generations of cultural transmission
	- Ethical issue of **"knowledge extraction"** of cultural intellectual property has caused 

- **Problems and challenges regarding traditional knowledge:**
	1. Different worldviews will emphasize different aspects of the same knowledge. Taking only what one sees as "relevant" leads to a distorted interpretation of the original knowledge
	2. Legal and ethical issues related to cultural intellectual property
	3. Power issues as the sharing of knowledge often takes place in a context of unequal power relations
	4. Knowledge is not found/distributed evenly among community members; local experts can be difficult to identify
	5. Eliciting knowledge can be difficult as many people don’t realize that they know what they know (tacit and intuitive knowledge vs discursive)
	6. Resistance towards "non-scientific" knowledge prevails in management circles

> Involving a wide range of actors in decision-making can allow for appropriate co-production of knowledge that respects the values and rights of all knowledge holders, which in turn has the potential to improve the quality of information and knowledge required to manage CAS

### Principles for Addressing Wicked Problems
1. Continual learning and **adaptive management**
2. Trust among stakeholders
3. Recognition of cross-scale interactions and collaboration and coordination across scales (local, national, etc.)
4. The recognition that landscapes have multiple uses and are subject to trade-offs
5. The inclusion of multiple stakeholders to represent these multiple uses
6. Transparency and mutual understanding
7. The clarification of rights and responsibilities
8. The importance of participatory and user-friendly monitoring
9. The importance of managing or planning for resilience
10. The strengthening of stakeholder capacity
