# GEOG298 - Week 3: Module 3 (The Human Dimension)

# Anthropocene
> Anthropocene ~ Geological epoch marking the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change

- 1950's = **"The great acceleration"**
	- Period of enormous growth, coinciding with the rise of **globalization**; significant point in the increased human impact on the Earth's environments

# Social-Ecological Systems (SES)
> "The social-ecological system (SES) concept makes explicit the two-way linkages between social and ecological systems. This includes links related to policies, management institutions, people’s knowledge (e.g., local or traditional knowledge), as well as informal social rules and norms that influence how humans interact with the environment"

- "Self organized systems governed by feedbacks"

- **7 principles for building resiliance:**
	1. Maintain diversity and redundancy in systems
	2. Manage the connectivity of systems
	3. Manage slow variables and feedbacks
	4. Foster complex adaptive systems thinking
	5. Encourage learning
	6. Broaden participation
	7. Promote polycentric governance

## Social-Ecological Resilience
- **Social resilience** = ability of communities to withstand external shocks to their social infrastructure
	- Systems may be **ecologically resilient but socially undesirable**, or **socially resilient but degrade their environment**

# Well-Being
> Well-Being ~ "A state of being with others and the natural environment that arises when human needs are met, where individuals and groups can act meaningfully to pursue their goals, and where they are satisfied with their way of life"

- Specifically related to the **indigenous notion of human well-being**
	- The act of living in harmony with ones environment; notion that this way of living is essential to human well-being
- The state of human well-being is a **desired target/outcome**

- **12 core themes of well-being:**
	1. Security of rights to territories, lands and natural resources
	2. Integrity of indigenous cultural heritage
	3. Respect for identity and non-discrimination
	4. Culturally-appropriate education
	5. Fate control/self-determination
	6. Full, informed and effective participation
	7. Health
	8. Access to infrastructure and basic services
	9. Extent of external threats
	10. Material well-being
	11. Gender
	12. Demographic patterns of indigenous peoples

## 3 Dimensions of the Social Conception of Well-Being
1. **Material**
	- Encompasses **practical welfare** and the **physical requirements of life** (income, assets, basic needs, physical health, ecosystem services such as clean air and water)
2. **Relational**
	- Encompasses **social interactions**, people's social/political/cultural identities, community cohesion, relationship with the state
3. **Subjective**
	- Encompasses intangible aspects such as cultural values, norms, trust, belief systems; also considers individual and shared hopes, fears, and aspirations

# Governance
> Management vs. Governance ~ “Management is about action, governance about politics. Management is about the implementation – in a technocratic sense – of decisions and actions in accordance with rules (these decisions and actions do not have to be restricted to the implementation of management tools per se, they can also relate to planning and assessment). Governance is about sharing responsibility and power; it is about setting the policy agenda and objectives and about the processes of implementing management actions”

- Governance “consists largely of negotiating conflict, making compromises and building (temporary) consensus, and leadership is not so much about the exercise of authority as about political brokerage, where conflicts are not necessarily resolved”
- The **UN Development Programme (UNDP)** defines governance as “the system of values, policies and institutions by which a society manages its economic, political and social affairs through interactions within and among the state, civil society and private sector.”
- **Governance is much broader than government**. It includes the structures and processes by which people in societies make decisions and share power, and it emerges from many actors
- Governance can be expressed and formalized “through subtle norms of interactions or even more indirectly through influencing agendas and shaping contexts in which actors contest decisions and access resources”

- **The UNDP describe "good governance" as having the following characteristics:**
	- **Participation:** all demographics should be represented in decision making, either directly or through institutions that support their interests
	- **Transparency:** Free flow of information; processes, institutions, and information are directly accessible to those concerned with them
	- **Accountability:** Decision makers are accountable to the public and institution stakeholders
	- **Effectiveness & efficiency:** Processes and institutions produce results while making the best use of resources
	- **Rule of law:** Legal frameworks that are fair and enforced impartially
	- **Responsiveness:** Processes and institutions try to serve all stakeholders
	- **Consensus orientation:** Decision makers mediate interests to reach a broad consensus on what is in the best interest of the group
	- **Equity:** All demographics have opportunities to improve or maintain their wellbeing
	- **Strategic vision:** Decision makes have a broad and long-term perspective on governance and development for the future as well as an educated understanding of the history and social/cultural complexities surrounding the situation

## Governing Modes
- **3 types of governing modes:**
	1. Hierarchical governance = **top-down management**
	2. Co-governance = **co-management**
	3. Self-governance = **community-based management**

- **Governance in SES occurs along a spectrum**, with **hierarchical governance** at one end and **self-governance** on the other end, and a range of different **co-governance** arrangements in between.

## Adaptive Governance
> Adaptive Governance ~ “a continuous problem-solving process by which institutional arrangements and ecological knowledge are tested and revised in a dynamic, ongoing, self-organized process of learning by doing”

- **Dealing with wicked problems and SES dynamics requires:**
	- Learning to live with change and uncertainty,
	- Combining different types of knowledge for learning,
	- Creating opportunities for self-organization toward social-ecological resilience, and
	- Nurturing sources of resilience for renewal and reorganization

- The Resilience Alliance defines adaptive governance as **“institutional and political frameworks designed to adapt to changing relationships between society and ecosystems in ways that sustain ecosystem services”**The Resilience Alliance defines adaptive governance as the “institutional and political frameworks designed to adapt to changing relationships between society and ecosystems in ways that sustain ecosystem services” (Resilience Alliance, n.d.).
- Adaptive governance is an approach to governing that promises to reduce uncertainty by improving the **knowledge base** for decision-making; emphasizes **experimentation and constant learning** due to the dynamic nature of social-ecological systems

### Loop Learning
- Learning can occur at multiple levels and knowledge about complex adaptive ecosystems often emerges over decades through peoples’ institutions and organizations. Different learning cycles have been referred to as multiple **“loop learning”**
