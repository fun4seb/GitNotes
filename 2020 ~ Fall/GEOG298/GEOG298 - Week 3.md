# GEOG298 - Week 3: Module 3 (The Human Dimension)

# Anthropocene
> Anthropocene ~ Geological epoch marking the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change

- 1950's = **"The great acceleration"**
	- Period of enormous growth, coinciding with the rise of **globalization**; significant point in the increased human impact on the Earth's environments

# Social-Ecological Systems (SES)
> "The social-ecological system (SES) concept makes explicit the two-way linkages between social and ecological systems. This includes links related to policies, management institutions, peopleâ€™s knowledge (e.g., local or traditional knowledge), as well as informal social rules and norms that influence how humans interact with the environment"

- "Self organized systems governed by feedbacks"

- **7 principles for building resiliance:**
	1. Maintain diversity and redundancy in systems
	2. Manage the connectivity of systems
	3. Manage slow variables and feedbacks
	4. Foster complex adaptive systems thinking
	5. Encourage learning
	6. Broaden participation
	7. Promote polycentric governance

## Social-Ecological Resilience
- **Social resilience** = ability of communities to withstand external shocks to their social infrastructure
	- Systems may be **ecologically resilient but socially undesirable**, or **socially resilient but degrade their environment**

# Well-Being
> Well-Being ~ "A state of being with others and the natural environment that arises when human needs are met, where individuals and groups can act meaningfully to pursue their goals, and where they are satisfied with their way of life"

- Specifically related to the **indigenous notion of human well-being**
	- The act of living in harmony with ones environment; notion that this way of living is essential to human well-being
- The state of human well-being is a **desired target/outcome**

- **12 core themes of well-being:**
	1. Security of rights to territories, lands and natural resources
	2. Integrity of indigenous cultural heritage
	3. Respect for identity and non-discrimination
	4. Culturally-appropriate education
	5. Fate control/self-determination
	6. Full, informed and effective participation
	7. Health
	8. Access to infrastructure and basic services
	9. Extent of external threats
	10. Material well-being
	11. Gender
	12. Demographic patterns of indigenous peoples

## 3 Dimensions of the Social Conception of Well-Being
1. **Material**
	- Encompasses **practical welfare** and the **physical requirements of life** (income, assets, basic needs, physical health, ecosystem services such as clean air and water)
2. **Relational**
	- Encompasses **social interactions**, people's social/political/cultural identities, community cohesion, relationship with the state
3. **Subjective**
	- Encompasses intangible aspects such as cultural values, norms, trust, belief systems
