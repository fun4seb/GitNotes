# GEOG298 - Week 4: Module 4 (Biodiversity)

# Types of Biodiversity
> Biodiversity ~ The variety of lifeforms found in a given region (ecosystem, nation, continent, etc.)

- **Biodiversity is discussed in terms of 3 levels:**
	1. **Genetic** diversity (variation within species)
	2. **Species** diversity (species richness)
	3. **Ecosystem** diversity

- **Hotspots** = particularly high levels of biodiversity within a relatively small area

## Genetic Diversity
> Genetic diversity ~ variety of different genetic types (alleles) in a population, species, or group of organisms living in the same area

- An **allele** is an alternative form of a gene. Alleles are found on **chromosomes**, each with a set of alleles for the same traits. 
	- For example there are different alleles for eye color among humans so human eye color varies from one individual to another. Only one of each matching pair of alleles is expressed, So if you have brown eyes but your mother has green eyes, you have both a brown-eyed allele and a green-eyed allele, but only the brown-eyed allele is expressed because it is dominant

- Populations with **greater genetic diversity** are more likely to be able to survive and adapt to changing conditions
	- Ex: Little brown bat populations that develop immunity to a previously deadly disease due to rich genetic diversity

## Species Diversity
> Species Diversity ~ the number of species and abundance of each species that live in a particular location

- **Biological Species Concept** = individuals that can **interbreed in nature** and produce viable, fertile offspring are members of the same **species**
	- Ex: A mule is not a species because it cannot produce offspring with another mule (it is a cross between a horse and a donkey and is infertile), however dogs and wolves can mate with each other and are thus the same species (Canis lupus)
	- the Biological Species Concept is **difficult to apply to organisms that do not breed sexually** like mushrooms. In these cases scientists use physically observable differences and increasingly genetic analyses to identify species

- Key example of **ecosystem services** provided by the biodiversity of species is **pollination**. A large proportion of the agricultural crops we consume are pollinated by insects (often bees), birds, or bats
	- Bees would not survive were it not for other components of biodiversity. They rely on plants and algae to provide the oxygen they need to breathe. Bees are protected from predation because of their bright warning coloration; if there were not an abundance of other similarly-colored toxic or stinging insects around to reinforce the warning message of this coloration, bees might be subject to much greater predation pressure

### Richness & Evenness
- **Richness** = the number of **different species** present in an area
	- Low richness = low diversity of species, high richness = high diversity of species

- **Evenness** = the **abundance** of each species that is present in an area; compares the **similarity of the population size** of each of the species present
	- Low evenness = more disparity between the populations of species, high evenness = less disparity between the populations of species

## Ecosystem Diversity
> Ecosystem Diversity ~ variety of different ecosystems existing in an area

- Ecosystem diversity, like genetic diversity, also provides for species diversity; **The more different ecosystems there are, the more different habitat types, leading to a greater variety of species**

### Ecosystem Services
- **Provisioning** (food, construction material, medicinal resources, artistic material, etc.)
- **Regulating** (climate regulation, water purification, waste treatment, infectious disease regulation, pest control, etc.)
- **Cultural** (recreation, tourism, cultural identity, spiritual functions, science and education, etc.)
- **Supporting** (nutrient cycling, primary productivity, etc.)

### Biodiversity & Human Well-Being
- Biodiversity is linked to the **three dimensions** of **human well-being:**
	- **Material:** people use the **material components** of biodiversity to meet needs in terms of income, food, physical health
	- **Relational:** biodiversity provides **opportunities for social interaction** and the relationships involved in the general and maintenance of cultural identities
	- **Subjective:** the biodiversity of an area is often linked to a place's **cultural identity**; **cultural keystone species**
