# GEOG298 - Week 4: Module 4 (Biodiversity)

# Types of Biodiversity
> Biodiversity ~ The variety of lifeforms found in a given region (ecosystem, nation, continent, etc.)

- **Biodiversity is discussed in terms of 3 levels:**
	1. **Genetic** diversity (variation within species)
	2. **Species** diversity (species richness)
	3. **Ecosystem** diversity

- **Hotspots** = particularly high levels of biodiversity within a relatively small area

## Genetic Diversity
> Genetic diversity ~ variety of different genetic types (alleles) in a population, species, or group of organisms living in the same area

- An **allele** is an alternative form of a gene. Alleles are found on **chromosomes**, each with a set of alleles for the same traits. 
	- For example there are different alleles for eye color among humans so human eye color varies from one individual to another. Only one of each matching pair of alleles is expressed, So if you have brown eyes but your mother has green eyes, you have both a brown-eyed allele and a green-eyed allele, but only the brown-eyed allele is expressed because it is dominant

- Populations with **greater genetic diversity** are more likely to be able to survive and adapt to changing conditions
	- Ex: Little brown bat populations that develop immunity to a previously deadly disease due to rich genetic diversity

## Species Diversity
> Species Diversity ~ the number of species and abundance of each species that live in a particular location

- **Biological Species Concept** = individuals that can **interbreed in nature** and produce viable, fertile offspring are members of the same **species**
	- Ex: A mule is not a species because it cannot produce offspring with another mule (it is a cross between a horse and a donkey and is infertile), however dogs and wolves can mate with each other and are thus the same species (Canis lupus)
	- the Biological Species Concept is **difficult to apply to organisms that do not breed sexually** like mushrooms. In these cases scientists use physically observable differences and increasingly genetic analyses to identify species

- Key example of **ecosystem services** provided by the biodiversity of species is **pollination**. A large proportion of the agricultural crops we consume are pollinated by insects (often bees), birds, or bats
	- Bees would not survive were it not for other components of biodiversity. They rely on plants and algae to provide the oxygen they need to breathe. Bees are protected from predation because of their bright warning coloration; if there were not an abundance of other similarly-colored toxic or stinging insects around to reinforce the warning message of this coloration, bees might be subject to much greater predation pressure

### Richness & Evenness
- **Richness** = the number of **different species** present in an area
	- Low richness = low diversity of species, high richness = high diversity of species

- **Evenness** = the **abundance** of each species that is present in an area; compares the **similarity of the population size** of each of the species present
	- Low evenness = more disparity between the populations of species, high evenness = less disparity between the populations of species

## Ecosystem Diversity
> Ecosystem Diversity ~ variety of different ecosystems existing in an area

- Ecosystem diversity, like genetic diversity, also provides for species diversity; **The more different ecosystems there are, the more different habitat types, leading to a greater variety of species**

### Ecosystem Services
- **Provisioning** (food, construction material, medicinal resources, artistic material, etc.)
- **Regulating** (climate regulation, water purification, waste treatment, infectious disease regulation, pest control, etc.)
- **Cultural** (recreation, tourism, cultural identity, spiritual functions, science and education, etc.)
- **Supporting** (nutrient cycling, primary productivity, etc.)

### Biodiversity & Human Well-Being
- **Biodiversity is linked to all three dimensions of human well-being:**
	- **Material:** people use the **material components** of biodiversity to meet needs in terms of income, food, physical health
	- **Relational:** biodiversity provides **opportunities for social interaction** and the relationships involved in the general and maintenance of cultural identities
	- **Subjective:** the biodiversity of an area is often linked to a place's **cultural identity**; **cultural keystone species**

# System Stability and Resilience
- The components of biodiversity contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in general and therefore to system stability and resilience

- **In the case of honey bees:**
	1. A diversity of other insects and birds leads to increased pollination efficiency of bees.
	2. A diversity of flowering plants is crucial to providing a season-long food source for the bees, therefore adding stability to the system.
	3. A diversity of ecosystems is crucial to providing habitat for a diversity of flowering plants, providing system stability.
	- (1), (2), and (3) above also provide for **resilience** of the system; if one other insect species or species of flowering plants or one ecosystem is wiped out by some type of disturbance (disease, fire, etc.), others will remain to maintain the bees which are crucial for a functioning pollination system.

# Keystone Species
- A **keystone species** is one for which the **removal from the system will lead to a regime shift**; a keystone species is one that is crucial to an ecosystem
- Keystone species have a **disproportionately large affect on their environment relative to their abundance**

- **5 categories of keystone species:**
	1. **Keystone predators**
		- **If a keystone predator is removed from an ecosystem, populations of their prey exponentially increase**, this can cause a **cascading effect** on other plants and animals within the ecosystem
		- Ex: Grey wolves that prey on elk and limit their population growth
	2. **Keystone modifiers**
		- Keystone modifiers, also called **"ecosystem engineers"**, are species that **create or significantly modify their habitat**
		- Ex: Black-tailed prairie-dogs helps maintain a diversity of plants in the American prairies that provide food for a diversity of other animals such as cattle and pronghorn sheep. Prairie-dog tunnels and burrows aerate the compact soil and allow water to penetrate deeper into the ground
	3. **Keystone prey**
		- Keystone prey can **cause significant fluctuations in predator densities and act as a key nutrient source for predators within an ecosystem**
		- Ex: Pacific salmon are keystone prey, playing a vital role in Pacific Northwest ecosystems, directly benefiting 89 bird species, 41 mammal species, 5 reptile species, and 2 amphibian species through ecosystem nutrient loading
	4. **Keystone mutualists**
		- Keystone mutualists are organisms that participate in **mutually beneficial interactions**
		- Ex: Hummingbirds pollinate highly specialized plants, which in turn are adapted to be pollinated only by these birds
	5. **Keystone hosts**
		- Organisms that harbor diversity through **allowing opportunities for other organisms to flourish and survive**; an organism that "hosts" other organisms
		- Ex: Aspen trees create an open canopy that harbors diversity on the forest floor, attracting many insects not found elsewhere in the ecosystem

- The greater biodiversity that keystone species help maintain affords protection of water resources and soil, pollution control, and better recovery from unpredictable environmental events

- **Not only keystone species matter however**; if a certain number of species were taken out, ecosystem collapse or regime shift will occur even if none of these species removed were keystone species

# Functional Redundancy and Response Diversity
- **Functional diversity** refers to the **diversity of functions** species carry out in an ecosystem; **function refers to the specific role each species plays in a system**
- Like species diversity, **functional diversity** is thought to increase the resilience and resistance of a system; functional diversity = functional redundancy + response diversity 

- A biological community is likely to be **resilient** if it has both **high functional redundancy** and **high response diversity**
	- **Functional redundancy = redundancy in the functions of species within a system**; no one function within a system is burdened to the responsibility of a single species as the responsibility is spread among many species meaning if that species were to be removed the functions it previously filled can still be carried out
		- If there are many top predators, a system has **functional redundancy**, meaning it will not collapse if one of these top predators is removed because the others will take its place. However if there is only one top predator within an ecosystem, its removal may result in ecosystem collapse
	- **Response diversity = components are not all affected in the same ways by the same disturbances**; there is a diversity in responses between components in an ecosystem meaning no single disturbance can destroy/impact every component of an ecosystem
		- Response refers to the **reaction of a species to disturbance**, whether this be natural or anthropogenic. For a system to be resilient, **response diversity should be among functionally redundant species**, such that, for example only one of two top predators in a system is negatively affected by a new epidemic disease or subject to market-driven hunting

# Protected Areas
> A protected area is a terrestrial or aquatic areas where land use and resource extraction are limited and conservation of biodiversity and/or cultural heritage sites is of prime importance

- Protected areas are a way to protect whole ecosystems, and thus the species that inhabit these ecosystems; **an ecosystem-based approach rather than a species-based approach to conservation**, recognizing the importance of maintaining all components of the ecosystem rather than just specific species identified as threatened

- **Humans** are part of the dynamic factors that make, or break, plans for effective conservation, even in protected areas where some forms of human activity, typically resource extraction (forestry, hunting, mining) is prohibited

- **Gap species** are those for which there is no protection plan found covering their native ranges 

## Importance of Connectivity
- **Connectivity** = degree to which organisms can move between patches of habitat in a landscape; important for the large-scale movements of terrestrial organism

> If organisms move between patches of habitat, the number of roads, for example, between the patches may have a very negative effect on animal survival and thus population sizes. Thus, the degree to which animals can travel from one protected area to another, or the degree of connectivity between protected areas may also be crucial to the effectiveness of these areas in conserving biodiversity, especially when it comes to large keystone species in need of extensive ranges for hunting and mating practices.

# The Role of the CBD
> The United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognizes and attempts to address the importance of including local and indigenous people in the biodiversity conservation process. The CBD is a multilateral treaty aimed at conserving biodiversity worldwide

- - The CBD stresses the importance of **traditional knowledge**
- Importance of **benefit-sharing**, which is the process of **sharing the profits of discoveries based in local or indigenous knowledge with the appropriate local or indigenous peoples**
	- Ensures that those who are stewards of biodiversity benefit from the technological and medicinal advances that come from the use/knowledge of this biodiversity

- The interests of local and indigenous people is managed through **Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDP's)**, the management of which is largely collaborative, and **Indigenous Peoples' and Community Conserved Areas and Territories (ICCA's)**, which are managed by indigenous peoples
	- Protected areas can be managed in a hierarchical way, which often involves the exclusion of local stakeholders, but they can also be managed collaboratively (co-governance) or governed by indigenous peoples or local stakeholders (self-governance)

# ICCA's
> The idea behind ICCAs, or Indigenous Peoples' and Community Conserved Areas and Territories, is that indigenous peoples will effectively conserve the biodiversity and ecosystems on which they have been materially, culturally, and spiritually dependent for generations if they are given the opportunity to do so.
