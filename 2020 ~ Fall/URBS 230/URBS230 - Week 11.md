# URBS230 - Week 11: Housing

# Reading Notes: Unequal and Volatile Urban Housing Markets - Walks & Simone
- The residential **housing stock** makes up a significant portion of the total fixed capital of any given city
- **Housing markets** are highly localized and also increasingly global
	- Residential **land titles** and **mortgages** acting as housing collateral are turned into financial commodities traded on global securities markets
- In most globally connected cities, some households live **transnational lives** (living and working in multiple countries)
- Housing is one of the most important factors in understanding modern urbanization processes, relevant to this is the **social and spatial inequalities in wealth accumulation within different social groups and neighborhoods**

> This chapter begins with a discussion of the basic structure of residential housing systems and markets in countries in the global North. It then analyzes changing in market structures and housing policies, including the globalization of housing finance and its relationship to the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC).

> The effects of these changes are then examined in relation to the volatility experienced in housing production and prices, and to inequalities related to access to housing and mortgage lending, particularly in the United States, which has the most globalized housing and mortgage markets, but also through case studies of the Irish and Spanish housing bubbles in relation to the Dublin and Barcelona metropolitan regions. 

> The chapter then discusses the implications for Canadian urban housing markets, comparing pre- and post-crisis conditions, as well as showcasing a study of Montreal. The chapter concludes with the reminder that the effects of housing bubbles and the global financial crisis vary widely among and within national contexts, as do their social implications and policy responses.

## The Structure of Housing Systems and Markets
- Most housing systems involve a series of **market, non-market, and quasi-market forms of housing**
	- **Market** = for-profit housing priced determined to supply and demand
	- **Non-market** = state-owned/provided housing that provide residence to lower income people who cant compete with capitalist market prices of housing
	- **Quasi-market** = housing with elements of both like co-operatives where pricing may be competitive but many decisions are left to the inhabitants such as maintenance and governance decisions
- In **non-market** housing forms, occupants are **selected on the basis of need rather than the ability to pay**; occupants pay for housing on the basis of **proportion of their income instead of the demand of the market**
	- Examples of this type of housing include **housing built and maintained by the state** (public housing), **non-profit rental housing** which is often subsidized by the state, and **co-operatives and rental co-housing initiatives** (residence share in governance and maintenance decisions)
	- The proportion of the occupied housing stock in non-market forms ranges from over 40% in Hong Kong, to 16% in France and United Kingdom, to less than 5% in countries of the global North like Canada, Australia, Spain, and most notably the United States
	- In many cities the proportion of the housing stock in non-market forms has **fallen considerably since the 1980's** due to **neoliberal policies** and **rapid growth of the private-market stock**

- Market forms of housing involve differed kinds of **tenures**: free hold ownership, **condominium** (strata) tenure, rent-to-own arrangements, market rental (leasehold) tenures
	- In the global North, the proportion of the population that own their housing ranges from 44% in Switzerland to over 90% in Eastern European countries; in the global South, a very large proportion if the housing stock is in market or quasi-market forms, with the vast majority involving **semi-legal or illegal squatter settlements** in which residents have limited tenure and land rights

- In **market-based** housing forms, occupants are chosen according to **willingness and ability to pay**; in competitive markets prices are picked due to variance in quality, maintenance, size, level of amenity, and location, all under to context of the **equilibrium between the supply and demand of unites**
	- **"Hedonistic"** = preference-satisfying model of price and rent determination
	- **"Consumer sovereignty"** perspective = assumes that cities have developed "naturally" according to common demand preferences that the market expresses through prices
		- Contrasted with **political economy approaches** = see access to housing and urban development and the "market" itself as unnatural and an expression of power among unequal groups (based on class, race, gender, and culture) including the power of land owners and developers

- **Bid-rent model** = each different sector bids different amounts per unit of land based on accessibility to employment in relation to distance from the **central business district (CBD)**; core feature of this model is that prevailing urban forms are the expression of consumer preferences in relation to the trade-off between accessibility and space
	- Offices, retail, and high-density residential sub-sectors (apartments and condominiums) **use land more intensively and thus are willing and able to out-bid other users for space in the central city**, whereas users with flatter curves like industrial buildings, low-density residential, and agriculture **win bids for land use near the fringes**
	- This model explains why many cities are organized the way they are with commercial towards the center in the CBD, with industrial and residential farther towards the outside of the city
	- "When the accessibility benefits of being near transportation routes are added to the models, a varied land-value surface is produced, with a strong peak at the center coupled with peaks of **diminishing intensity at the intersections of key transportation routes** as distance from the CBD increases"

- Racial discrimination in the United States pushed black populations to live in particular urban districts; state retrenchment and neglect enabled the reproduction of racialized housing markets even after civil rights legislation dissolved more formal racially motivated policies
	- **Redlining** = mortgage lenders refusing to provide mortgages in neighborhoods seen as "high risk"; initiated in the 1930's by the US Federal Housing Administration (FHA) who used different colors to represent neighborhood trajectories and judging their level of credit worthiness
	- **Reverse redlining/"yellowlining"** = process where mortgage lenders identify and target certain neighborhoods for aggressive loan marketing
	- Some scholars argue that the **politics of zoning** increased population densities in poorer areas and led to lower population densities in wealthier areas of US cities.

- Markets are inherently social, political, and cultural phenomena

## Evolution of Housing and Mortgage Markets
- The first models for non-market housing included utopian communities built in the **United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe during the 1800's (first bourgeoisie suburbs)** and the Boundary Estate housing project built in London in the 1890's
	- However for the most part it wasn't until the 1920's in Germany and the United kingdom, and the 1940-50's in North America and other European nations that public (state-provided) housing projects were planned on any scale
	- Was only after WWII that non-market forms of housing became common enough to compete with private-housing forms

- Across the global North, until the mid-1930's **states had little direct influence** (through state-run insurance programs or regulations), on lending practices in private-mortgage markets; **after WWII many countries in the global North developed mortgage markets** according to social and political objectives
	- National regulatory bodies were set up to **monitor, regulate, and sometimes directly insure mortgages** issued by lenders; in 1938 USA had the FHA begin insuring mortgages issued by approved lenders and established the **Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae")** to purchase these mortgages and set mortgage-lending terms
		- From this point banks were more encouraged to be more involved in insured mortgage-lending practices (with most insurance protecting the bank and not the borrowers)
		- **"Conforming mortgages"** = mortgages which set limits on loan-to-value ratios, amortization terms, loan amounts, and property purchase prices

- Some countries followed the US in establishing housing organizations with similar functions and policies **(Ex: the state-run Japan Housing Loan Corporation or JHLC)**; some nations in the global South set up similar organizations with weaker impacts such as in Mexico and Brazil with the housing they developed being overrun with the rapid spread of unplanned squatter settlements

- From the post-WWII period until the early 1980's mortgage-lending systems ensured the smooth flow of funding for housing constructions; most people were deemed credit-worth and able to move into housing located in new suburbs while **neighborhoods with older housing were subjected to redlining and denied access to mortgage credit**
	- Race and other social characteristics played a role in limiting people's access to credit and **black neighborhoods were much more likely to be redlined than other neighborhoods**
	- Groups who could access other forms of funding (through family or community channels) often ended up owning the housing of older neighborhoods
	- The result is that **inner-city housing shifted towards the spacial concentration of social, racial, and ethnic/immigrant groups** following the post-war period; contrast to when districts closest to the CBD were most valuable/desirable

- In the US housing and mortgage corporations were restructured and began innovating in the trade of **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**
	- **Mortgage-backed securities** = pooling many mortgages into a single security; the owning of many mortgages that can be sold as a single entity
	- This system uses the financial power of the state to promote credit creation on behalf of private-sector lenders, but on terms dictated by the state

- From the 1980's-2000's housing systems across the global North **transformed in ways to discourage non-market forms of housing and force privatization upon the housing industry** (Ex: in the UK the most desirable public-housing units were privatized through "right-to-buy" schemes and discouraged the building of new social housing)
- **HOPE VI** program = program where social housing units in the US were rebuilt as **"mixed" tenure communities** which held very separated living spaces between market-owned units and socially subsidized units

- As nations adopted similar policies of discouraging socialized housing, non-market housing increasingly lost to private-market housing; often poorer areas sitting on accessible land near the CBD were **redeveloped with housing intended for the middle classes and elites** (gentrification)
- Under **gentrification**, cities saw the displacement of lower-income households into less-accessible neighborhoods containing less desirable market housing and "residualized" (under-maintained and ignored) non-market housing; this led to cities becoming increasingly segregated by class, race, and immigrant status

- The shift towards gentrification/discouragement of non-housing forms promised lower government budget defects and private-sector investments into housing; many nations brought in **securitization schemes** and encouraged competition in the mortgage insurance industry through granting new licenses to private-sector mortgage brokers
- The **securitization of housing assets** can be seen as an important component of the neo-liberalization of housing policy; it was also a factor in the production of **greater volatility and crisis in housing markets**

## Financialization, Volatility, and Crisis
> Recent shifts in housing finance are part of the wider financialization of the economy in which "profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production"

- Securitization of MBS allows for spatially fixed houses to become globally tradable financial assets, thus producing financial liquidity out of the geographically fixed urban housing markets

> The rise of private label MBD and their subsequent use in collateralized debt/mortgage obligations, in which bunches of MBS are pooled and then "tranched" (divided into different securities) based on the level of perceived risk, helped promote the "financialization of home"

- The growing popularity of mortgage securitization practices globally led to a rapid increase in the amount of financial securities offered on the market, and the amount of credit available for the purchase of housing and land
	- This resulted in driving up housing and land prices and encouraging new housing and office development
- **Capital switching** = massive switch of capital investment into land and housing markets (Harvey's **second circuit of capitalism**)

> In the United States, the profusion of mortgage credit, coupled with the fact that, with securitization, lenders no longer needed to hold mortgages on their balance sheets but instead could sell them to intermediaries for packaging into MBS, meant that lenders had an incentive in raising the volumes of their lending yet little interest in ensuring that borrowers could pay back the loans; caused predatory forms of lending and contributed to volatility and housing market crash

- **Subprime mortgages** = mortgages offered to borrowers with bad or "less-than-prime" credit scores, justified by higher interest rates; led to **much greater chance to default** and with large populations defaulting due to predatory mortgage practices, situations like the **2008 housing crisis** can occur
- **Key characteristics of subprime mortgages:**
	1. High interest rates and fees
	2. Initial "teaser" interest rates that reset upward after a few years
	3. High pre-payment penalties
	4. Loans issued on the value of the collateralized property instead of the borrowers ability to pay
	5. "Loan flipping" characterized by frequent financing
	6. "Balloon" payments in which the term ends with a substantial principle payment, compelling the borrower to refinance beforehand
	7. Negative amortization

> The American housing bubble burst led to mass foreclosures and led to an unprecedented response from the US federal government and the US Federal Reserve in which they resorted to massive bailouts of the financial sector and automobile companies, historic stimulus/spending packages, and new programs and policies intended to encourage the banks to lend and households to borrow and spend

- In **slow-growing and de-industrializing cities that had already experienced high foreclosure rates leading up to the crisis**, new foreclosures were disproportionately concentrated in central-city neighborhoods; cities that fit this pattern include: Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Denver
- In **"hot-market" cities that were growing leading up to the crisis**, new foreclosures were disproportionately concentrated in newer suburbs located at the urban fringe where Hispanic households were significantly more likely to experience foreclosure; cities in this pattern include: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Miami
- Many lower income households were effectively stripped of their equity and left deeper in debt, while wealthier households and higher income neighborhoods were far less likely to suffer from house-price declines, foreclosures, or equity loss

> Even in nations that experienced equally deep house-market downturns as the US did, the effects on urban development and the articulation of urban social inequalities vary considerably. This can be seen in relation to two European that experienced unprecedented housing bubble bursts: Ireland (Dublin) and Spain (Barcelona)

## The Impact of Ireland's Housing Bubble on Dublin
- **Ireland's "Celtic Tiger Era"** = period where Ireland sustained one of the largest housing bubbles in recent history; characterized by a neoliberal focus on deregulation, prioritization of free-market principles, and the privatization of public services
- Ireland's Celtic Tiger era can be divided into **two distinct periods:**
	1. Early to late 1990's saw increases in **foreign direct investment (FDI)** in export-oriented manufacturing and services sectors fueled a growing population, declining unemployment, and a rise in standard of living
		- Financial deregulation and low corporate tax rate encouraged many transnational companies to invest in Ireland
	2. By early 2000's exports had declined while lower interest rates fueled a construction boom. Tax structures were favorable towards the construction sector and Irish banks could not keep up with the demand for credit, resulting in them borrowing from foreign institutions, which heavily favored the residential property market. New housing prices rose drastically and the number of units being built grew twice as fast as the population; the bursting of the housing bubble then came quickly after the global financial crisis of 2008.

- Housing burst led to **"ghost estates"**, where condo buildings and housing developments underway at the time of the crash were left empty and unfinished
- Housing crisis led to mass emigration attributed to job loss (people left to find new jobs), climate-related issues like flooding, and demographic shifts have led to changes in the socio-spatial composition of the city

- Ireland was forced to ask for a 85 billion euro bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union, and the European Central Bank (ECB); the **"troika"**

- The final result of the crisis is a mass surplus of unfinished, empty housing that while the state encourages developers to finish, are now inhabited by low-income households, squatters, and desperate populations

## The Spanish Housing Bubble and Its Aftermath in Barcelona
- In the years leading up to the global housing crisis, Spain started the development of over 5.5 million housing units which represents more housing units started than France, Italy, and Germany combined

- By 2008 in Barcelona, **de-concentration,suburbanization, and gentrification**, had produced a neighborhood landscape characterized by class and immigration status differences
- During 1997-2006, Spain experienced rapid growth and development due to a cultural preference for ownership over renting, aspiration to own second properties, and foreign investors; this resulted in the **over-building** enabled by an over allowance of land supply due to legislation that classified most of the country as "suitable for development"
	- Mass development led to a **large increase in immigrant populations**
	- Households, firms, and governments **believed in the possibility for unlimited growth and did not plan for the possibility that the economy might go in reverse**

- Spain is distinct in that they do not allow for debtors to be freed from debt through bankruptcy and many have to continue paying charges and growing interests even after their houses have been foreclosed
	- Many immigrants are caught in this trap and cannot raise enough money to return to their countries
	- This has also pushed Spain's youth out of the labor market and since the global financial crisis, Spain's youth have experienced unemployment rates of over 50% producing a **"lost generation"** and giving rise to social movements such as the **Platform of Mortgage Victims (PAH)**

## Canadian Housing Markets Before and After the Global Financial Crisis (Focus on Montreal)
- Canadian housing market is often seen to have avoided the financial crisis, due to its oligopolistic banking structure and state regulatory functions
	- Despite this Canadian banks received substantial bailout funds at similar levels to nations who did experience the crisis

- The Canadian housing market did not decline nor correct to nearly the same degree as other countries such as the US or Britain; real house prices continued to rise in a smooth fashion even after the global financial crisis. The reason this happened is due to the way that **state institutions regulate the private mortgage market and in the way the state responded to the crisis**

> A key feature of the Canadian system is the role of the state as a main funder of both non-market forms of housing and mortgage insurance for conforming private residential mortgages

- The **Central/Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** was established in 1946 with the dual aims of **building non-market (public and social) housing** and **insuring mortgages issued by lenders for the purchase of housing**

- Montreal has the lowest level of homeownership (55%) among Canadian metropolitan areas (compared to the 69% nation average), however Montreal has a relatively typical geographic distribution of household debt, mostly in the form of mortgage debt
	- In Montreal the lowest debt values (proportional to household disposable income) are found in areas near the CBD, around condo units, and in the eastern part of Montreal; The highest debt burdens extend westward in a "V" shape covering parts of Laval and the West Island suburbs (areas of Montreal that contain more immigrants)

## Conclusion
- One key aspect of neoliberal urbanism has been the use of securitized lending to stimulate private-sector mortgage insurance and the development of secondary mortgage markets, and with them a rise in home ownership
	- While this leads to benefits for investors and households that wish the access credit, it also has led to an explosion in household debt and government debt due to mass bailouts and "stimulative" responses

- The bubbling and collapsing of housing markets in countries such as the United States, Ireland, and Spain have led to a **restructuring of their urban economies**

- In cities that were already growing fast before the crisis, **the suburban fringes were the places that experienced the worst effects of a bursting housing bubble**; while in slow-growing de-industrializing cities, **the worst effects were felt within inner-city working class communities**

- In the postwar era, many countries in the global North developed housing systems according to social and political objectives, but since the late 1980's they have favored private-market provision over non-market forms of housing

- Securitization of MBS allows for spatially fixed houses to become globally tradable financial assets, thus producing financial liquidity out of the geographically fixity of urban housing markets

- Rapid house price increases in a given city or nation are often fueled by increasing ease of access to mortgage credit; the increasing adoption of mortgage securitization practices across the globe led to an increase in the amount of credit available for the purchase of housing and land, and contributed to the rise of housing bubbles

- The way that housing markets and mortgage markets operate in the United States has augmented, rather than ameliorated, inequalities related to class and race

- The bursting of Ireland's housing bubble left many unfinished housing estates in Dublin, particularly in the newer suburbs, contributing to changes in the socio-spatial composition of the city

- The pain of the bursting housing bubble in Barcelona is deep and shared widely among those in the working and middle classes, including many immigrants. Spain's distinctiveness in relation to its bankruptcy laws has led to new social and political movements seeking to change legislation around housing-related debt

- A key feature of the Canada housing system for the majority of the postwar period is the important role played by the state

- There is a strong reflexive relationship between rising housing costs and mortgage debts. The vast majority of the increase in household debt levels in Canadian cities is due to the larger mortgages required to purchase housing on the private market, as well as to the ease by which households have been able to access mortgages

# Podcast Notes: Giant Pool of Money
- **CDO** = Collateralized Debt Obligation; **"tranches"**/slices of MBS's (which are already a pool of many mortgages) pooled together ("a pool of pools")
- **NINA** = no income no asset; a loan with virtually no income or asset qualifications required, setting up the borrower to default by approving loans they cant pay off
- **The global pool of money** = all the money in the world being saved, held within in banks, insurance, companies, etc.; basically all the available saved money in the world pooled together
	- There is **~70 trillion** in the global money pool; **this amount has doubled since 2000** (in 2000 the pool was ~36 trillion)
	- The global money pooled doubled in such a quick time due to **many poor countries suddenly becoming rich** and producing products and oil like China, India, Abu Dhabi, and Saudi Arabia
= **MBS (mortgage backed securities)** = many mortgages, collected by smaller banks, are pooled together by large banks producing a large income, then shares of that income are sold to investors
	- Extremely lucrative and the supply of MBS could not keep up with the demand so banks had to **find ways of producing more mortgages**; as everyone who qualified soon had mortgages, banks had to start giving mortgages to people who never would have qualified to keep up with demand
	- The risk of these NINA loans was not a problem for the bank because they did not bear the responsibility of borrowers paying them back and only looked to sell the mortgage accounts to wall street

- Big problem was that the data that banks had to review all pointed to positive results as **they were not updated enough to consider the effects of these new kinds of predatory loans such as NINA's**; many risky loans could be pooled into MBS and appear as **"money good"**

# Movie Notes: The Inside Job
- Opens with Iceland, GDP of 13 billion where the banks lost 100 billion
- In 2000 Iceland begun a policy of **de-regulation** that had consequences for firstly the environment and then the economy
	- They started by **allowing multinational corporations to exploit Iceland's natural resources**
	- The government then **privatized three of Iceland's largest banks**
		- When the banks collapsed at the end of 2008 unemployment tripled in 6 months

- The collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG triggered a global financial crisis in September of 2008

## Part 1: How we got here
- After the great depression the US had **40 years of steady economic growth**
- In the original model, partners put up the money they were investing and therefor watched it very carefully
- In 1982, Reagan **deregulated savings and loan companies allowing them to make risking investments with their depositors money**; by the end of the decade hundreds of these companies had failed, many investors went to jail for investing their clients money such as **Charles Keating**

- During the Clinton administration **deregulation continued**
- By the 90's most of wall street was consolidated into a handful large corporations that were so big that their failure had huge consequences to the system
	- **"Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act"** = Act that overturned the glass-stegal act that allowed huge companies to merge together, leading to monopolies; **allowed Citicorps and Travelers to merge into Citigroup**
	- "Deregulation has led to the end of compartmentalization"; analogy of a boat with separate fuel compartments that are separated to prevent the boat from capsizing, deregulating removes these barriers and allows the "boat" to collapse
- Banks refused to self-regulate themselves and engaged in rampant white-collar criminal activity
	- Ex: Citibank, JP Morgan, and Merril Lynch helped Enron conceal fraud and was fined 385 million

- Deregulation and advances in technology lead to an explosion in financial products called **derivatives** that made markets increasingly unstable
- Using derivatives **bankers could gamble on virtually anything**; they were extremely lucrative and by the late 90's they were a 50 trillion dollar unregulated market until 1998 when **Brooksley Born** attempted to regulate the derivatives market, something wall street fought aggressively to stop
	- In 2000 Congress passed the **Commodity Futures Modernization Act** that **banned the regulation of derivatives**

- **Securitization food chain** = chain of loan payments: home buyers -> lenders -> investment banks -> investors; "ticking time bomb of no responsibility where riskier loans are encouraged without risk"
	- Securitization ensures that the people who make the loan are not at risk if the borrower is unable to pay, this is different from the past where the person lending expected the borrower to pay that person back with no other parties in-between
	- Encouraged risky **subprime** loans because they carried higher interest rates and lenders took n responsibility if the loan could even be paid; **lead to a missive increase in predatory lending**

## Part 2: The Bubble (2001-2007)
- Predatory loans meant that **anyone and everyone was buying houses** and this caused house prices to skyrocket resulting in the **biggest financial bubble in history**
- **Leverage** = ratio between a banks borrowed money and their actual money, the more a bank borrows the higher their leverage
	- In 2004 Lobbyists fought to **relax limits on leverages** allowing banks to **sharply increase their borrowing**, allowing investment banks to gamble a lot more

## Part 3: The Crisis
