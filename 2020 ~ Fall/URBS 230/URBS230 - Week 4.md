# URBS230 - Week 4: Industrial Chicago

# Lecture Notes
- Cronon is arguing against the notion that the success of Chicago was due purely to innate natural advantages; he argues that the success is due much more to human improvements on the land ("second nature")

- **Boosters** = people who speculate the future success of Chicago and are invested in its predicted success

- First nature vs second nature
	- **First nature** = natural environment
	- **Second nature** = man made environment

- Railroads were **privately funded**; "unprecedented level of capital invested into railroads"
	- "...a railroad was a pool of capital designed to make more capital"
	
- **Long distance travel is much more efficient than short distance travel** due to the many **fixed costs** of railroad maintenance

- "Commodification of time"; The railroad connects the world, runs on standardized time, people start to value time more and rely on regularity in train schedules
	- Before railroads, ones sense of time is based on the suns height in the sky

- Telegraphy + railroad = key technologies that revolutionized the world by decreasing the time it took for information and people/goods to travel from place to place; **a more connected world = a smaller world**
	- Example of **globalization** (much like the development of Paris' railroad network)

- Chicago was the **connecting point of East-West travel** in the United States, **this was the biggest strength of Chicago location in the railroad network**; all railroad lines converge in Chicago
	- **"Fan lines"** that fan out west of Chicago like branches, and **"trunk lines"** that travel in a more concentrated pipeline East towards New York

# Uneven Development
- Capitalism develops unevenly, some places will grow incredibly fast while others might struggle economically
- Why do some places develop faster than others?
	- Each place has **natural advantages** related to its geographic location that influence its **economic potential**
		- Ex: Cities located on a waterfront have access to water travel/trade and allow capital to flow in and out of the city
		- Natural advantages = **"first nature"**; Human created advantages = **"second nature"**

- Concept of **path dependency**; previous actions directly influence the path of future actions
	- Ex: Once Chicago is already established as a central node within the railroad network, future railroads have no choice but to point towards Chicago, creating a **self fulfilling prophesy of growth** in Chicago as speculated by Boosters

# Industrial Location
- **Location factors:**
	- Transportation
	- Markets
	- Inputs
	- Upstream & downstream activities
	- Labor supply
	- Ancillary activities

- **Knowledge workers:**
	- Airport
	- Data network
	- Quality of life
	- Creative class argument
	- Density: face to face

- **Agglomerations** = when many companies exist in the same space synergistically
	- Ex: The film agglomeration of Los Angeles
