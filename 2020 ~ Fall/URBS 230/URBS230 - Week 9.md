# URBS230 - Week 9: The Neoliberal City

# Reading Notes: Incremental and Instant Urbanization - Ogunyankin & Buckley
- Over the years National geographic published articles related to the rapid growth of certain cities:
	- First article on Lagos, Nigeria and the informal economy that developed alongside the city where merchants sell every possible item
	- Second article on Dubai that focuses on the city as a shopping capital of the world where diamond encrusted phones sell for 10,000$
	- Third article on the **"instant cities"** of China that feature an unprecedented speed of urbanization; "China is in the fast lane"

- Rapid urbanization often associated with **human deprivation** and **unruly development**; "un-modern global city contenders trying to leapfrog their economies into the twenty-first century through the ruthless, relentless pursuit of unbridled consumerism and globally marketed mega-projects"
	- **Colonial and Eurocentric assumptions** about what cities ought to be; negative perception of non-western urbanization as deviant and rule-breaking; **harmful narrative**
	- Rapid urbanization in non-western regions seen as deviant, perverse, excessive, and ultimately illegitimate

- **Chapter looks at Dubai and Ibadan, Nigeria as case studies:**
	- "The Dubai case study emphasizes the ways that international markets for finance and labor have sustained processes of rapid, large-scale urbanization"
	- "The Ibadan case study highlights the gendered relations of urban settlement and development and the everyday politics of class and income that shape growth and development"

## Urban Growth & Change in Perspective
- While urbanization is often claimed to be a global phenomenon, the process is deeply uneven in speed, form, and the socio-economic conditions that drive it
- Estimated that by 2050 an additional **2.5 billion** people will live in cities and over 90% of this urban growth occur in the **global South**
	- **Global South** = The less socio-economically developed global regions in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East; Countries of the Global South have been described as newly industrialized or in the process of industrializing; similar term to "third world"

- **Urbanism** = refers to **ways of being in a city**, such as urban practices of living and interacting with each other
	- **Informal urbanism** = "refers to ways of living and interacting in cities that can involve garnering or distributing resources (water, food, jobs, houses, etc) in semi-legal/illegal ways. These kinds of relations transect the lives of both poorer and richer urban residents across the global North and South"
	- **Spectacular urbanism** = "refers to ways of being or relating in cities that rely heavily on the promulgation of a global sense of place, on the development and interaction with urban built-environments that are architecturally striking, grand or novel and/or the production of urban lifestyles that rely heavily on cosmopolitan forms of urban consumption"

- **Urbanization** = refers to broad set of **processes** that transform space into an urban setting
	- **Instant urbanization** = "Urbanization that appears to be happening rapidly, often involving the fast development of very large parcels of land and involving complex, multi-use developments on a grand scale; a process often involving centralized forms of urban development undertaken by a small cadre or state or market actors"
	- **Incremental urbanization** = "A term often used to describe forms of urban growth and change that happen bit by bit. This form of urbanization can be rapid or gradual, but generally entails the production of urban space through a large number of small, cumulative and independent actions undertaken by many different people over time"

- The four concepts of urbanism and urbanization **do not exist in isolation and can be connected to each other**

## Urbanization, Globalization, and Spectacle
- "Bold and centralized interventions into the urban built-environment have long been a fundamental strategy of expressing national, imperial, dynastic, colonial, authoritarian, or totalitarian power throughout history"

- **Urban entrepreneurialism** = forms of governance and global place-making that aim to **attract regional and international investment**
- **Urban imagineering** = marketing the city as a **desirable destination or attractive place to live** for parties such as business elites, global professionals, or tourist populations
- **Urban integrated mega-projects** = large-scale development projects usually built for profit by a single developer; privatization of urban and regional planning as **international actors** now play a central role in urban planning

- The Chinese Central Television (CCTV) building is an example of a **state's assertion of sovereignty and power outwardly through the built-environment**

- **"Fire" sectors** of finance, insurance, and real estate

- "The unprecedented amount of wealth being accumulated in the global economy, coupled with financial markets' growing ability to gather ever-larger amounts of this wealth together across borders, is one key reason that such "instant", large-scale forms of urbanization can take place"

- **Exploitable labor** is an important facilitator of rapid large-scale urban development
	- Construction sectors tend to rank among the largest employers of national economies in both the global North and South
	- New migrants to cities often play a crucial role in constructing them; important to city building as they often do the jobs that no one else wants to do

- Urban construction labor markets are historically male dominated however much of the lowest status jobs are predominantly women

## Spectacular Urbanism and Instant Urbanization: Constructing Dubai
- UAE possesses some of the largest oil reserves in the world and as a result their economy is dominated by the oil industry
	- Dubai has little of these reserves resulting in the royal family looking to other sources of revenue for their economy

- UAE and Dubai are **structurally dependent on foreign workers** across the public and private sector; **vast majority of its population is non-citizens**
- Dubai had to rewrite several policies to encourage speculative investment such as allowing foreigners to own property.
- Workers are entirely dependent on their employer for their visas, housing, transportation etc. resulting in the exploitation of workers as their entire economic security is in the hand of their employer who can cancel their visa at any time
- Workers are often not paid on time or at all

## Incremental Urbanization and Informal Urbanism
- Contrasting the large-scale projects being rapidly constructed in Dubai, the most common form of urbanization is incremental in nature
- Incremental urbanization of the global South is often not understood in the same way as the gradual urban growth in the global North; often depicted an anomaly and a hallmark of poverty

- "Minimal basic dwellings" constructed by urban dwellers of global South, examples being favelas/shantytowns/slums; **informal settlements**
	- Share similar characteristics such as precarious topography, inadequate access to basic services, and poor building materials

- **Informal settlements** = residential areas where a group of housing units have been constructed on land to which the occupants have no legal claim, or as unplanned settlements and areas where housing is not in compliance with planning and building regulations

- Most urbanization taking place in the global South is **incremental in nature**
- A contributing factor to the rapid growth of cities in the global South is **rural-urban migration**, both voluntary and involuntary
	- **Voluntary migration** occurs when migrants are in search of better job opportunities and economic security in the city, usually in the informal sector
	- **Involuntary migration** often occurs due to rural land dispossession, displacement caused by corporate **land grabbing****, or migration due to conflict or climate change
		- **Land grabbing** = the privatization and commodification of rural land as a part of neoliberal policy goals to increase local/global investment; while companies and the state profit largely off of rural land acquisition, rural inhabitants can become displaced and robbed of their livelihood

- The process of re-engineering urban space often entails the framing of informal settlements as the antithesis to modernity, resulting in the destruction of settlements and the displacements of its inhabitants that often lead to conflict and state-sanctioned violence
	- Those who become displaced are forced into housing situations that are often worse than their previous housing that they were evicted from

- Concept of the **right to the city** which prioritizes the rights of urban dwellers over that of capital and the state. Also entails their right to participate in the decisions regarding the use and production of urban spaces

## Re-Framing Informality
- Concept of **subaltern urbanism** which emphasizes the entrepreneurial and political agency of the urban poor while highlighting their lived experiences and survival/subversion tactics
	- Informality as a form of grassroots revolution that is a deliberate opposition to state bureaucracy; promotes the concept of **heroic informality** which is celebrated resistance to the formal
	- This concept allows informality to be used as an anti-colonial practice

- Concept of **pirate urbanism** where media and technological infrastructures that are otherwise exclusive to the more wealthy are stolen/siphoned for use in illegal settlements (Ex: Stealing cable or hooking up wires into the electrical grid to receive free energy)

- Concept of **occupancy urbanism** where surplus real estate is appropriated illegally by urban residents and government efforts to entrench master planning is defied and thwarted

## Informal Urbanization and Informal Urbanism: Constructing Oke-Foko, Ibadan
- Ibadan is currently undergoing urban renewal projects in efforts to make it a "world class city"
	- Major challenge to this goal is that of improving Ibadan's more "unsightly" areas such as the slum of **Oke-Foko**

- The word **slum** refers to settlements with poor sanitary and housing conditions however it also is a **politicized term**; often used from an outsiders perspective and is a value judgment on those living in such areas

- **Gender issues** as women in Oke-Foko are not included in the planning process and their sanitation and infrastructure needs are not being met by the government as men dominate the planning process with attempts to modernize the city and its slums without addressing the underlying problems of a lack of infrastructure and availability of basic services.
