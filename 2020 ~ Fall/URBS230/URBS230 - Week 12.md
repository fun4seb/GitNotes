# URBS230 - Week 12: Gentrification

# Reading Notes: Is Gentrification a Dirty Word? - Smith (1996)
- **How can we define gentrification?**
	- Gentrification is a **process**, by which poor and working-class neighborhoods in the inner city are refurbished via an influx of private capital and middle-class home buyers and renters
	- "Once this process starts in a district it goes on rapidly until all/most of the original working-class occupiers are **displaced** and the whole **social character of the district is changed**"
	- "The class remake of the central urban landscape"
	- " The class-less reclaiming of urban space"

- **Is gentrification good or bad?**
	- Put simply, **yes it is bad** and **yes it is a dirty word**
	- People who are advocates of gentrification never use the word "gentrification", choosing other words like "neighborhood recycling", "upgrading", or "renaissance"
	- Using the word gentrification is a critique of the process, because **it is a dirty word**

- **How is contemporary gentrification different from its historical precursors?**
	- Anachronistic or analogous uses; the word is overused and very common/trendy
	- Hunter-gatherers were displaced by agricultural peoples and while many may call this gentrification this is clearly a different process not based around class.
	- Was Haussmann's renovation of Paris gentrification? Yes as it entailed the class transformation of neighborhoods, however this is anachronistic as the word did not exist at the time

- **What has changed and what has stayed the same since Smith wrote this?**
	- Gentrification has advanced
	- Negative usage has won
	- Gentrification as postmodern urbanism?
		- Gentrification is **neoliberal urbanism**, not postmodern
	- "Revanchism" comes and goes

- Understand **production side vs consumption side** theories of gentrification
	- **Consumption side** = middle class people are returning to the city; this is a cultural move of changing consumer tastes/aesthetic trend
	- **Production side** = its about capital returning to the city; change is the result of capital finding new areas to grow and a product of the market economy rather than a cultural phenomena of changing tastes

- Connection to Haussmann's Paris, Chicago zonal model, Engels' Manchester
	- Gentrification entails the class transformation of the ring of poverty surrounding the CBD, so rather than waiting for the CBD to grow they appropriate the land and displace the people for new capital to come

# Reading Notes: Loft Living - Zukin (1982)
- **What is the relationship between artists and gentrification?**
	- "Shock troops of gentrification"; first wave early gentrifiers of students, gay men, bohemians, intellectuals
	- Changing cultural values
	- Commodification of the **anti-modern search for authenticity**

- Loft gentrification
	- Supply created demand?
- Cultural explanation: "...artists' living habits became a cultural model for the middle class"
- Political economy explanations
	- Deindustrialization
	- Movement of capital
	- Role of the state
		- "No real estate market develops without state intervention"
	- Role of banks
	- Developers
