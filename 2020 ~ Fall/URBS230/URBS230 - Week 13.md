# URBS230 - Week 13: The Third World City

# Reading Notes: The Myth of Marginality - Perlman (1976)
- **How does this relate to our discussion of informal urbanism?**
	- Informal urbanism = informal housing; slums/makeshift housing, not state-sanctioned housing, degraded housing
- **Informal urbanism**
	- Informal sector = housing + commerce (+transportation)
		- Housing = informal housing market, commerce = street vending
	- Informal settlements
		- Land tenure, services, rules; **key characteristic is that people do not have clear property rights to the land they are using**
		- 62% Africa, 30% Asia, 25% Latin America
	- Rural-urban migration
		- Push/pull factors
		- Accumulation by dispossession ("commodification and privatization of rural land")
		- Proletarianization

- The reason informal settlements/slums are not removed in third world cities is because there is no alternative, governments cannot provide housing and it is politically smarter to just leave such settlements alone

- **What is the myth of marginality?**
	- Stereotypes that don't hold up
	- Social disorganization
		- Family breakdown
		- Anomie
		- Mutual distrust
		- Rampant crime
		- Violence
		- Promiscuity
	- Urbanization without breakdown
	- "Culture of poverty"
	- Rapid urbanization: negative, positive, cynically accepting
	- Favelas: pathological agglomerations, communities striving for elevation, pobres coitados

- **Urbanization in Latin America**
	- Rapid decline in mortality, constant birth rate; life was hard in the countryside and living in the city lowered the death rates by providing more accessible health care services; less people are dying while having the same amount of children leading to a natural population increase in cities
	- Brazil 86.5% urban in 2019
	- Rio favelas 22% of population/territory

- **Why do people migrate?**
	- Push
		- Modernization of agriculture (mechanized agriculture no longer requires labor workers)
		- War in the countryside
	- Pull
		- Bright lights, big city
		- Jobs, improve one's life
		- Better services

- **Structural causes of "over urbanization"**
	- Post WWII Latin America
	- Modernization of agriculture
	- Green revolution
	- Import substitution (ISI)
	- Deepening of ISI
	- Debt crisis of the 1980's
	- Austerity, Neoliberalism, dismantling of ISI
	- IMF conditionality, World Bank structural agreement loans

- **History of Rio's favelas**
	- Slave city until 1888
	- 19th century Corticos
	- Quilombos
	- Passos reforms 1902-2906

- **Perlman on CHISAM:** "From 1968 until its demise in 1975 it removed over 100 favelas, destroying more than 100,000 dwellings and leaving at least half a million poor people without homes"

- **Consolidation of favelas**
	- Pastoral das favelas
	- Liberation theology (churches supporting favelas in resisting removal)
	- Bento Rubiao
