# URBS230 - Week 2

# Urban Origins of Capitalism
> Capitalism: dynamic system/mode of production, social system for producing what we need according to demand; Characterized by dynamic growth, inherent change, and **instability**

- Capitalism is a **mode of production**; production being done in a different way

- Factors that contributed to the birth of capitalism:
	- Initiation of long distance trade (~1000 AD)
	- Changes in agriculture
	- Cultural changes
		- **Weber's ideas on the emergence of Protestant Calvinism and how it contributed to the birth of the capitalist mentality**; material success reflects a selection from god, creating an **ideological/cultural incentive to profit**

- Capitalism needs:
	- Market in land, labor, capitalism, commodities
	- Rational accumulation
	- State power
	- Class
- Cities were centers of production, consumption, innovation, **coordination**

# Cities
- Cities are **"rational landscapes for capital accumulation"**; In other words **"machines"** for the growth of capital
	- Growth through **production**, **circulation** (movement of people, goods, and money), **realization** (market functions), and **social reproduction** (production of a healthy working class)
	- The importance of reproduction outlines the key contradiction of capitalism (**healthy/happy workers are necessary for capitalist growth** yet capitalist tendencies often result in **exploitation of workers** instead)

## Origins of Cities
- **Roman Empire**; connected Europe with roads, infrastructure, unified law and order, etc.
- Ecclesiastical towns (towns centered around the nucleus of a cathedral, headed by a bishop)
- Lay Bourgs
- **Feudalism**
- Italian trade (10th century) in Venice, Genoa, Florence; city-states dependent on trade goods (prevalent merchant class)
- Crusades 11th century
- Trade (often exotic goods from the Middle East)
- Bourgs on trade routes, faubourgs
- Walls

## Proto-Towns as Incubators for Capitalism
- Week fragmented sovereignty (no clear property rights)
- Walls
- "Stadtlift macht frei"; **"Cities will set you free"**
- Footloose merchants
- Recycling of Roman law (vs. judicial law, trial by ordeal)
- Cit charters, commune, third estate
- Citizenship
- Innovation
- Markets: Land, labor, capital, commodities
- **Greenfield site:** feudalism = system for managing space; city = **new space**

> Greenfield Site ~

- **Layout of the medieval city:**
	- Concentric walls
	- Core: palace, cathedral
	- Parishes (organizing residents based on their church)
	- Craft districts
	- Walking city
	- Access to rivers/ocean port

# Industrial Revolution
- Industrial revolution (1760-1860)
	- Agricultural concentration
	- Country and city relationship
	- Technological change, division of labor

- Division of labor: spinners and weavers,men and women, country and city

- Key technologies & commodities:
	- Wool, cotton spinning, weaving
	- Coal, iron, steal, steam engine
	- Canals, railway, shipping
	- Empire

# Engels & Manchester
- Outlines the geography of how classes are divided
- Invisible poverty (capitalist tendency of hiding poverty, Engels references how shops line the road shielding the sight of the slums)
- Describes the state of housing, food, sanitation, morality

## Layout of Manchester
- Industry/CBD to center, rich to suburbs
- Concentric ones
- Wealth = status
- **Home and work separated** (The rich can own and work in the city center, but live in comfort in the suburbs)
- Class, rather than occupational differentiation
- Classes separated **spatially**

# Reading Notes: The Condition of the Working Class in England - Engels (1845)

## Key Questions
- **What was so revolutionary about the Industrial Revolution?** (compared to Childe's description of "revolution")
	- Fundamental changes in livelihood across society in a relatively short time span, mass obsolescence of workers through the invention of increasingly efficient machines and automation
	- Rapid advancements in the technological capabilities of humans
	- "Economies of scale"

- **Does Engels like the city?**

## Chapter 1: Historical Introduction
- History of the English working class begins in the 18th century with the invention of powered machinery & engines that lead to the **industrial revolution**
	- Social consequences of the industrial revolution = emergence of the **industrial proletariat** (which in turn leads to the **inevitable exploitation of workers** according to Engels)

- Workers lived comfortably in rural areas **without the need to go into towns**, selling their goods to traveling agents and local markets
- Engels repeatedly states rural life as **"Idyllic"**, and describes the almost fairytale like qualities of living in harmony "side by side" and contrasts such a carefree lifestyle with what he considers the disgusting and vice-filled lifestyle of urban dwellers
		- **"Children grew up in idyllic simplicity and in happy intimacy with their playmates"**

- Machinery outmoded many forms of labor previously outsourced to the countryside
	- Engels uses weavers and textile workers as an example of a job that was previously done by rural dwellers. With the invention of machines to automate their livelihood, people are robbed of their ability to support themselves in towns disconnected from urban centers, **leading to mass migration for work into the city**

> "In the absence of temptation to immorality they lived god-fearing decent lives"

- In this quote **Engels links immorality with urban life**, something he does many times in this text revealing a key part of his world view and value system

> "They were not much troubled with intellectual and spiritual problems and the even tenor of their lives was seldom disturbed" ... "Their unquestioning humility enabled them to live peacefully side by side with the higher ranked of society"

> "Yet they remained in some respects little better than beasts of the field. They were not human beings at all, but little more than human machines in the service of a small aristocratic class which hitherto dominated the life of he country" ... "The industrial revolution carried this development to its logical conclusion, turned the workers into mere machines , yet it was this change that caused the workers to think for themselves"

## Chapter 3: The Great Towns
- Engels uses Manchester as the stage to describe how classes and districts are divided according to status into different "quarters", and the social consequences of what he sees as the **gross exploitation of the working class** (slums, poor quality of life, public health issues, etc.)

> In the center of Manchester there is a fairly large commercial district ... this district is almost entirely given over to offices and warehouses. Nearly the whole of this district has no permanent residences and is deserted at night"

- This quote shows why censuses track night population, daytime density of city centers are often not representative of the actual size of a settlement; **Cash nexus â‰  population nexus**

> "Owing to the curious layout of the town it is quite possible for someone to live for years in Manchester and to travel daily to and from his work without ever seeing a working-class quarter" ... "This division is partly due to deliberate policy and partly to instinctive and tacit agreement between the two social groups"

- Residential layout of city: Commercial center > working class > middle class > upper class **(which is connected back to commercial center through omnibus routes)**

> "These plutocrats can travel from their homes to their place of business in the center of the city by the shortest routes, **which run entirely through working-class districts**, without even realizing how close they are to the misery and filth that lie on both sides of the road"

- **The slums are hidden from the upper class**, who travel the main channels into the city (through slums), because the roads are lined with shops owned by the lower middle class; **a facade shielding the rich from the sight of the poor**
- Engels describes the state of the slums of Manchester and notes that the **inhabitants have little/no access to basic cleanliness**, forced to use the waters of polluted rivers or overcrowded public outhouses for basic hygiene.
	- He feels the allowed existence of such states of living are disgraceful and **highlight how the upper class exploit workers and force them into filthy hidden districts behind shops and thoroughfares**

> **Engels perfectly summarizes his points on the consequences of industry on page 64:** "It is only industry which has crammed them full of hordes of workers which now live there. It is only the industrial modern age which has built over every scrap of ground between these old houses to provide accommodation for the masses who have migrated from the country districts and from Ireland. It is only the industrial age which has made it possible for the owners of these shacks, fit only for the accommodation of cattle, to let them at high rents for human habitations. It is only modern industry which permits owners to take advantage of the poverty of workers, to undermine the health of thousands to enrich themselves. Only industry has made it possible for workers  who have barely emerged from a state of serfdom to be again treated as chattels and not as human beings. The workers have been caged in dwellings which are so wretched that no one else will live in them" ... **"Industry alone has been responsible for all of this and yet this same industry could not flourish except by degrading and exploiting the workers."**

- Industry leads to the emergence of slums through the need for cheap accommodation of the masses (the workers who are exploited yet essential to the system must live somewhere!), **compare this to how people lived in rural areas pre-industry before mass migration into urban centers and it is easy to see why Engels idolizes the conditions of pre-industrial life**

- Nothing is maintained nor built well in working class quarters because the turnover is so quick, buildings are just erected and left to be condemned in a lifespan of no more than a few decades; **older the development = worse/closer to end of life**

- Note the different types of arranging houses and the way their organization **promotes a low quality of life and contributes to the exploitation of workers**
	- "The layout of the dwellings reflect the greed of the builder for profits from the way in which ventilation (space between dwellings) is lacking"

- Engels then talks at length about the deplorable state of the working class' clothing and how it is reflective of their lack of profit, as well as how **the division between classes is visible in the clothing and material one wears**
- Engels also describes the state of the working class diet and how **the working class is exploited by the middle class**, being deliberately sold tainted meat and food cut with fillers
	- Also mentions the tendency for **starvation** as many working class people had such little profits they **could not afford proper food on a daily basis**

### Summary of Engel's Points
1. Vast majority of the inhabitants of great towns/cities are workers
2. Workers posses no property and live hand to mouth on their wages
3. Workers do not have the means to create satisfactory **permanent** provisions for their family
4. Even skilled workers can lose their livelihood, leading to starvation due to no savings for essentials
5. Working class quarters are badly organized and promote disease and "immoral activity" (according to Engels) due to their density
	- Houses are in disrepair, badly ventilated, damp, and **unhealthy**; overall neglect from health officials
	- **Slums were hit extremely hard in times of cholera**
6. Workers are herded into the smallest possible spaces and often one or multiple families all share one room
7. Clothing is inadequate and diet is poor and inedible
8. Workers families often go short of food and in extreme cases die of starvation
