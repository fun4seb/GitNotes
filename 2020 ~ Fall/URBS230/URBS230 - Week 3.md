# URBS230 - Week 3: Haussmann's Paris

# Haussmann & Renovation of Paris
- **Paris Timeline:**
	- 1789~ French Revolution
	- 1799 ~ Coup, Napoleon I
		- **First empire**
	- 1848 ~ **Economic crisis**, February revolution, second republic (President Luis Napoleon), June days
	- 1851 ~ Coup, Emperor Napoleon III
		- **Second empire** (focus of Harvey's text)
	- 1871 ~ Paris commune

## Purpose of Paris' Reform
- **Modernist ideals**, keeping up with the British (in terms of civil advancement), personal ambitions
	- Ex: Les Halles vs Crystal Palace, International Exhibitions
	- **Idea that the British pioneered industrial capitalism and the French were attempting to keep up as they adopted capitalism later than the British**
- Economic: efficiency, over-accumulation of capital, second circuit of capital, creative destruction; **breaking out of old structures**
- Social control: working-class neighborhoods, barricades, barracks
	- Haussmann deliberately designed the city in way so that it would be easier to control through organized force
- Legibility and **simplification**
	- "No geometrically and topographically precise plan of the city of Paris had never been established"
	- **The simplification of environment allows an area to be more easily policed and controlled**, by contrast medieval cities were almost impossible to police due to a disorganized layout that limits social control
	- A city that has a simplified layout is much more capable at delivering services
- Create "elite" spaces

## Paris' Public Space
- Changing dynamic of face to face interactions vs. **anonymity**
	- The size of a city directly determines the type of relationship a citizen has with all other citizens; the larger the city, the more impossible it is to know everyone **(face to face = accountability)**, and the more anonymous you are to all other people in a city 
- Segregation + social mixing
	- The development of boulevards allows much more people (of all classes) to freely walk all parts of Paris = more social mixing
- Spectacle of Paris
	- Center for consumption, public works, empire

## Haussmann's Planning of Paris
- Largest urban renewal to date
- Influential model for urban renewal around the world
- Laid out a grid for future expansion
- Example of large scale planning/intervention, a **strength of authoritarian governments**
- **Beaux-Art architectural style: neo-classical, Greek & Roman**
	- Bringing back classical architecture to Paris
- Financing: Credit Foncier, Credit Mobilier

# Capital Accumulation and the Built Environment
- Accumulation refers to the **cultivation of capital** (something that has value; money, goods, etc.)
	- Over-accumulation occurs when you have too much of something (Ex: too much capital that has nowhere to be invested, or production of too many goods that cannot be sold)

- The **commodity** (important Marxist concept)
	- **Use value** (usefulness and function of a commodity) and **exchange value** (monetary value of a commodity)
		- Commodities require both, **if something has no use value it does not have a marketable monetary value**
	- Housing as a commodity with conflicting use and exchange values

- **First circuit of capital accumulation:**
	- Accumulation by expanded reproduction (reinvesting surplus capital into more production in a cycle)
	- The production of **commodities**
	- **M > C > M'** (Input = Money capital > Commodity production > Output = More money capital)
		- Process leads to a surplus value
	- Limits of accumulation by expanded reproduction

- **Crisis of over-accumulation**
	- Spacial fix (expanding to new territory)
	- **M > M'** (credit money, bidding up asset prices; **turning money directly into more money**)
		- Second circuit of capital accumulation
	- "Accumulation by dispossession"
		- Enclosure of the commons
		- Privatization
		- Commodification
	- Devaluation

# Harvey: Paris 1850-1870
- Harvey's text continues Engels' story of the industrial revolution
	- Explores Paris' population growth and urbanization
	- Describes the extent of industrialization in Paris; greater movement of goods and people
	- Outlines how changes were less about technological innovation (as they were in Manchester)
	- Transportation revolution: **expansion of French railroad network**, telegraph, ports; **growing interconnectedness**
	- Change as a result of **top down** management, **centralized control over Paris' development**

- **Globalization of Paris**; France is now connected logistically with the entire world and competition begins to occur at an increasingly grand scale as a result

- **Primacy:** Concept of Paris as a **"primate city"** (Disproportionately largest city within a country that is the center for all government, economy, population, industry, etc.)

## Paris Finance
- **Key Figure: Pereire Brothers**
	- "Association of capital"
	- **Credit Mobilier**
	- Leveraged/borrowed money; **"fictitious capital"** (credit)
		- The renovation of Paris was funded by leveraged money; investment into the future of a more efficient city in the future

- General atmosphere of **speculation**
	- Shift in focus towards wealth earning urban properties
	- In 1880 53.9% of people stated their profession as "landowner"

### Real estate market
- The simplification of Paris' layout allowed the real estate market to be much more organized, compared to the chaotic market of a medieval city that developed organically of centuries
- **Left bank** = aristocrats and shop keepers
- **Right bank** = large capitalist organizations
- **Embourgeoisement** (gentrification)
	- Pushing the poor out of the center of the city and **making it more uniformly bourgeois**
- Sorting of classes and land-uses
	- Pushing industry to the edges of Paris along with the workers

# Reading Notes: In Consciousness and the Urban Experience - Harvey
- **Key questions:**
	- How was Paris transformed during the period?
	- What were the objectives of the transformation?
	- What were the unintended consequences?
	- How did this transformation serve the needs of capital?

- Paris in 1850 was burdened by social, economic, and political problems
- Largest capitalist economic crisis as a result of **over accumulation**

## I. The Organization of Space Relations
- Reorganization of France **spatially**

- **"New space relations" = reorganization of space**; growing connectivity of a nation through development of transportation networks, leading to a greater flow of capital through easy of movement of goods and information
	- "The changing space relations were a fundamental aspect of the shifting political economy of Parisian life"

- The rise of **Napoleon** as Emperor allowed France to enter an era of massive self-investment; to direct and unify its efforts and expend it resources in ways to heal the French economy after a period of depression
	- Mass construction of a road and railway network across France from 1850-1870, financed by the pre-1850 surplus of accumulated wealth; allowed for the **circulation of capital**

- What was Haussmann's role in the development of Paris?
	- Chosen by Napoleon to carry out a massive urban renewal program of new boulevards, parks and public works in Paris commonly referred to as **"Haussmann's renovation of Paris"**
		- Mass investment of public works allowed Paris to radically improve efficiency through greater connectivity of all capital (achieved through development of roads, stations, logistical networks, etc.)
		- Outlines how effective **urban planning can lead to economic development** through a greater organization of resources allowing for more opportunities for capital accumulation.

> "Haussmann's projects depended upon the existence of companies that had the financial power to develop, build, own, and manage the spaces he opened up."

- **Reoccurring concept of "freeing" capital from historic constraints to be put to better use towards the urbanization of Paris**

## II. Money, Credit, and Finance
- Reorganization of France **financially**

- **Key French financial figures:** the Pereires, Rothschild
- Creation of various financial institutions that had an enormous effect of the transformation of Paris **(under the influence of the Pereires)**
	- **Credit Mobilier**

- Reorganization of the credit system; **indebtedness** was a chronic problem in all classes

## III. Rent and the Propertied Interest
- From 1848-1852, the Parisian property market underwent the deepest depression of the century

- Emergence of a class of people who identified solely as **landowners**
	- Conflict between landowners and the people
	- **Landowners resistance of Haussmann's development plans**; conflict of ideologies

> "If Paris was to be transformed, then capital had to be mobilized, not only into buying and selling, but also into demolition, reconstruction, and long-term management of the urban space according to collectivist principles that were quite alien to the privatism of tradition property owners."

# Reading Notes: Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of Suburbia - Fishman

## How does Fishman define the suburb?
- "Beyond the city"
- "Suburbia can thus be defined first by what it **includes**, and second, by what it **excludes**"
	- Separation of work from family life (previously living and working was done in the same place, **now the two are split up**; work is conducted in the city while the bourgeois live comfortably in the suburbs)
	- The poor are excluded through a lack of privilege
	- Gender relations (women become excluded from public life, the city, business, politics)
		- **"Closed domesticated nuclear family"**

## Who invented suburbia and why?
- Suburbs were first established in London and Manchester by the bourgeois during the process of industrialization **(see zonal model)**
- Idea of a **bourgeois utopia** (creation of a "picturesque" isolated perfect world for the elite)

## How did 19th century Paris and London solve the same problem differently?
- "Broadly speaking, continental and Latin American cities opted for the traditional structure, while British and North American cities followed the path of middle-class suburbanization"


- Suburbia as a **middle class** invention; assertion of class wealth and privileged
	- Radical rethinking of the relationship between residence and city
	- "The true center of any bourgeois society is the middle-class house"
- Suburbia represents a new ideal of family life

> "Suburbia is more than a collection of residential buildings; it expresses values so deeply embedded in bourgeois culture that it might also be called the bourgeois utopia"

- Suburb = **"beyond the city"**; residential community beyond the core of a large city
- The suburban world is based on the principle of **exclusion**
	- Work was excluded from the family residence
	- Middle class villas were segregated from working-class housing
- **"Self-segregation"** of bourgeois culture; separation of the middle-class from the urban-industrial society they themselves were creating

> "Suburbia can thus be defined first by what it includes-middle-class residences-and second (perhaps more importantly) by what it excludes: all industry, most commerce except for enterprises that specifically serve a residential area, and all lower-class residents (except for servants)"

- While separated from the urban core, **the suburbs depends on the city economically for the jobs that support its residents**; also **culturally dependent on the core for the major institutions of urban life:** professional offices, department stores and other specialized shops, hospitals, theaters, etc.
	- **Economic & cultural dependence on the city**

> "This radical rethinking of the meaning of the city and of domesticity was not the work of a single architect of genius, who proposed a new model and then convinced his clients of its worth. Rather, suburbia was a  collective creation of the city's bourgeois elite, a gradual adoption of a new way of living by a  class that had the wealth and confidence to remake the world to suit its values"

- Suburbia was a cultural creation, a conscious choice based on the economic structure and cultural values of the Anglo-American bourgeoisie; suburbia was not the deliberate creation of any single person or group

- Fishman states the most crucial motive for the creation of suburbs during the industrial revolution: "the closed domesticated **nuclear family**"
- The cultural motive of **suburbanization** (the nuclear family's need for separation between residence and work) was compounded with an equally impactful **economic motive**
	- The idea of suburban living outside the confines of the city allowed previously cheap agricultural land to be converted to residential plots and therefor be profited from, providing the economic engine to fuel suburban expansion forward; **suburbia become a good investment**

- Fishman outlines what he describes as **"exemplary suburbs"**, or suburbs which were unique in execution for their time and provided a replicable model for which future suburban developments can imitate for success
	- The suburbs on the outskirts of **London** defined the **quintessential suburban image** as well as pioneered the strict **segregation of class and function** for which later suburban developments would imitate; this execution of suburban design however was first worked out in **Manchester**

> **(Talking about Manchester's urbanization)** "For the first time one sees a middle class that is wholly suburbanized; and, as necessary correlates, a central business district devoid of residents and a crowded, smoky factory zone between the central business district and suburbia. Frenzied land speculation, bitter class conflict, and the alluring image of the bourgeois utopia combined to restructure the basic components of the city"

- **Paris = antithesis to the suburban model**. Paris utilized transportation networks to expel industry and the working-class outwards while the bourgeois concentrate towards the core; **the city center became the location of privileged comfort rather than the distant suburbs outside the city,** the bourgeois **maintained their hold on the urban core**
	- The difference between city layout in Paris and English cities can be attributed to both long-term differences between **French and Anglo-American images of the city** and to **Haussmann's massive rebuilding/renovation of Paris**

- Fishman states that after 1870 the site of the "exemplary suburb" shifted to the **United States** as they adopted and innovated on the design of English suburbs

> The suburbs that arose outside the American industrial cities at the end of the nineteenth century were the classic embodiments of the whole history of suburbia. They not only summed up the design tradition now more than a century old, but they provided the model that all subsequent suburbs have attempted to imitate

- American suburbs were distinctively separated from the industrial city however completely connected and accessible through the streetcar and railroad system
	- The single theme that differentiates the twentieth century suburbia from its nineteenth century ancestors, is the **attempt to secure for the entire middle class (as well as the working class) the benefits of suburbia**, which in the classic nineteenth century suburb had been restricted to the **bourgeois elite alone**
	- American suburbs mark the emergence of the **"suburban paradox"** **"how can a form of living based on the principle of exclusion attempt to include everyone?"**

- **Key example of Los Angeles as a "suburban metropolis", why is Los Angeles unique in its suburban development?**
	- "The end of suburbia in its traditional sense and the creation of a new kind of decentralized city"
	- **"Technoburb"**
