# URBS230 - Week 5: US Suburbanization

# Film Notes: Rethinking Urban Sprawl - Duany

## What's wrong with the North American Post WWII automobile suburb?
- McMansions: "A pretty good product"
- Congested city life: "Low quality public realm"
- Idea that the suburb has "all the ingredients of the cake, just not put together"; **"Extreme separation of functions in the city"**
	- The various functions of a city are **separated** from each other: housing, shopping, schools, workplaces
	- **Cars and freeways** are **required** to connect the various functions; the automobile becomes a key factor in suburban life
- The ideology of the suburb (bourgeois) is that the home is a **"sacred place"** and that work and other institutions are not to intrude on the home, thus leading to a planning scheme centered around the seclusion of housing 
- A significant amount of space is designated to **parking lots** within the suburban landscape
- The over reliance on automobile transport leads to elevated traffic that **obstructs pedestrian space and freedom**
- **"Single income ghettos"**: Developers build entire neighborhoods of only one type of home that is then marketed to a specific income bracket

## Public Space
- The "death of public space"
	- With the separation of functions within suburbs, the spaces between areas, which traditionally act as public spaces, are **removed and replaced with the convenience of roads and freeways** that connect everything. This is compared to a walking city where the entire space available to pedestrians acts as public space

- **What are public spaces good for?**
	- Citizenship, democracy: activity within public spaces among the masses reinforces solidarity and cohesion among people who share/frequent that space; a natural space for more involved citizen participation
	- Enjoyment
	- Economic benefits: networking, trust

- Ray Oldenberg: **"Third places"** = public spaces
	- Argues that people live in **three kinds of spaces**: home, work, and **public spaces**
	- Public spaces encompass all spaces that exists between work and home; the suburbanization and deliberate separation of these spaces leads to a **loss of third places**, thus losing all the benefits that public spaces provide to cities

## What does Duany Purpose?
- **(Neo) traditional urbanism**; Duany is a key figure in the **New Urbanism** movement
- Uses examples of **Alexandria, Virginia** & **Sonoma, California** to outline his perceived benefits of **mixed use** and **mixed class** within cities
	- Mixed use
		- Leads to more lively public space
	- Mixed class
		- Makes argument "Learning from your social betters"; arrogant, problematic argument
		- References **"Social mixing"** which is often an argument/excuse for **gentrification**; excuse to move rich people into poorer neighborhoods and thus displacing the poor

## New Urbanism
- New Urbanism is the current planning trend
- Good on paper, **but often not in execution**

- In practice, **most New Urbanism is just higher-end "better" suburbs catering towards a wealthier demographic of buyers**
	- New Urbanism design elements: porches, walkways, village greens, cars to the back
	- New urbanist areas often incorporate a **story** through consistent architecture style however **all this is simply marketing of a product**
	- A market-based solution

# Reading Notes: A Theory of Suburbanization: Capitalism and the Construction of Urban Space in the United Space - Walker
- **The argument:** Post-WWII suburbanization in the US is the product of spatial differentiation, spatial dispersal and waves/stages of urban development
	- "Supports the argument of the class that cities can be seen as a product of capital accumulation, and that different periods of urban history can be seen through the lens of different periods of capitalists development"

- What has been the role of technology in industrial dispersal?
	- Technology is a dependent variable not a independent variable, Walker is interested in what **caused** the development of technologies
	- Technologies as part of **"growth ensembles"**
	- New technology is the **product** of the accumulation process, **not the force that drives it**; the drive to expand causes development of new technologies which then facilitate the expansion

> Growth Ensemble ~ A "package" of things that develop and go together such as technologies, products, and systems of production that contribute to a rapid surge in growth during a specific economic period (Ex: Suburbanization characterized by the development of the automobile, highway, and suburban house that develop and exist together as an ensemble)

- What has been the role of **"the state"** in suburbanization?
	- Policies at various levels of government that were **explicitly enacted to promote suburbanization**
		- **Local governments** who actively promote suburbanization through zoning and taxation policy
		- **State and Federal governments** who promote suburbanization through subsidization of suburbs and policies such as redlining

- Housing is a product with both **use** and **exchange** value; The exchange value of a commodity is the **money value on the market**, The use value is the **qualitative value to the user**
	- Ex: The **exchange value** of my coat id $100, while the **use value** is that it keeps me warm in winter

## Spatial Differentiation
- Historical development of the US city
	- Separation of home and work
	- **Non-residential differentiation**
		- First CBD: warehousing, wholesaling, manufacturing
		- After Civil War: concentration of shopping districts
		- 1890's sees first large scale corporations which lead to the development of corporate headquarters, professional services
		- Transportation: allows the sorting and viable separation of functional spaces connected by transportation; **this is partly what enables the development of suburbs** as it allows the secluded bourgeois residential areas to be accessible to other key services through technologies such as trains, cars, and highways
		- Sorting by function: agglomerations
		- Forces of repulsion (ugliness of industrious and overly dense cities)
		- Zoning
	- **Residential differentiation**
		- Division of labor
		- Social reproduction spaces
		- Class structure
		- Consumption spaces
		- Employment linkages ("you live where you live because of where you work")
		- Space as buffer: Suburbs being placed on the outskirts to create space between the classes as a buffer of protection for the bourgeois from the lower class
		- Community identity
		- Real estate sorting: dealers, financial institutions, "the state", users

## Decentralization
- **Residential suburbanization**
	- Led by elite
	- 1830's: "big bourgeoisie" moves to the edge of the city enabled by the connectivity of train networks and ferries that allows capital to remain in a CBD while the bourgeois migrate to the suburbs; **separation of home and work**
	- Civil War: small middle class of clericals, professionals, petty entrepreneurs followed by horse-drawn streetcars
	- 1890: corporate capitalism, new middle class
	- White collar office workers, trolley car
	- WWI: lower middle-class, working class
	- Post WWII: Large scale middle, working suburbanization

- Idea of suburbs as a **"greenfield space"**: undeveloped land that offers a high degree of freedom for developers compared to land with existing development that may inhibit the creation of new spaces
	- "The fringe of the city was sought out, because it was the easiest place to carve out an appropriate space within which to fashion a whole mode of consumption and reproduction"

- **Suburbanization of the working class**: sheer imitation, inability to forge a class-alternative, interventions of dominant classes
- Vertically integrated corporations, Fordism, economies of scale, factories disperse, offices in CBD, telephone, railroad, trolley
- Repulsion: traffic, "suburban solution to class conflict"

- Retail and traditionally female labor followed residential into the suburbs

> "Mass suburbanization of today is strongly mutually reinforcing, and would not be possible without a whole ensemble of uses moving outward together"

- **Property circuit**: developers/speculators, financial institutions, the state
	- "**Inner city disinvestment** and **suburban investment** processes are intimately related"

## Stages/Waves
- Accumulation cycles
	- **50 year Kondratieff waves**
- Growth ensembles (regulation theory)
	- **Fordism** = Big corporations that are **vertically integrated** and take advantage of **economies of scale** for mass production
	- **Post-Fordism**
- Reorganizing spacial relations, urban obsolescence (creative destruction)
