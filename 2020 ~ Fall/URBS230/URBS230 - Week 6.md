# URBS230 - Week 6: Los Angeles Freeways & Suburbs

# Reading Notes: The City as a Freeway - Hall
- **Le Corbusier**: Swiss planner tasked with solving the planning problems of Paris left behind from Haussmann's renovation. Proposed the demolition of the city center to provide new space to solve density issues with things such as **high rise buildings**
	- **The key was solving the famous paradox:** "We must de-congest the centers of our cities by increasing their density. In addition, we must improve circulation and increase the amount of open space. The paradox could be resolved by building high on a small part of the total ground area"
	- Understood the importance of **Greenfield spaces** for their freedom of development
		- “WE MUST BUILD ON A CLEAR SITE! The city of today is dying because it is not constructed geometrically.”
		- “Statistics show us that business is conducted in the center. This means that wide avenues must be driven through the centers of our towns. Therefore the existing centers must come down"
