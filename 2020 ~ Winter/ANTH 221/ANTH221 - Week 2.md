# ANTH221 - Week 2

> Anthropology ~ Study of humans, past and present

> Symbolic Anthropology ~ Field of anthropology that seeks to understand cultures through the lens of symbols

# Symbolism
- Symbols are more than objects: ways of speaking, body language, hairstyles, hand gestures, etc. are all symbolic
- There IS a difference between a simple sign and a complex symbol
	- A symbol has a lot of content to it; its polysemic (has lots of meanings)
- Symbols include abstract things like colors, words, ideas, numbers, etc.; certain experiences are symbolic, like rites of passage; rituals are symbolic, too

> Polysemic/Polysemous ~ Having multiple meanings

## Symbols Vs. Signs
> Semiotics ~ Study of signs

- A symbol is a kind of sign, but symbols are a much more complex means of communication
- like signs, symbolic meanings are also arbitrary and can vary cross-culturally (**symbols are not universal however the existence of symbols is**); however, symbols are **polysemous** meaning that they have multiple meanings
- Simply, signs communicate one meaning; symbols are more complex as a simple sign
	- Ex: X = Y
- 9th century linguist **Ferdinand de Saussure**, influential in linguistics, showed that language is more than words that act as labels for things rather, **language is a system of signs** made up of **Signifiers & Signifieds***
	- Therefor a **linguistic sign** is made up of 2 parts:
		1. **Signifier**: A word
		2. **Signified**: The idea that word invokes
- Simply, the difference between a symbol and a sign is one of DEGREE rather than KIND
	- both communicate, but symbols carry more content and are suggestive of larger ideas(cultural, social, emotional, psychological) than simple signs
- Non-human animals communicate by way of signs rather than symbols; prof says **animals are not capable of symbolic communication in the way humans are**

# Nature & Culture
- Culture needs more than one person as it is cultivated and maintained in a group setting
- Complex symbolism is characteristically human
- Humans have natural instincts, requirements, etc. However, **culture also tends to convert those natural elements into symbolic forms**
	- Ex: **Biological sex** is converted into a system of cultural categorization, **gender**, which varies across cultures; The **nourishment of the body** is elaborated into culture-specific **cuisines** and beliefs about food
	- **Culture mediates nature by way of symbols**

# Approaches to the Study of Symbols

## Evolutionist
- **EB Tylor**: Culture as “conscious,” degree concept, teleological, West as the apex of civilization
	- EB Tylor’s view of cultural symbols: symbols or objects had functional meaning in the past but as society/culture develops the original use/meaning is lost and is worshiped in a more “meaningless” or irrational way due to losing track of the roots of why something was worshiped in the first place
- **James Frazer**: Magic as “failed science,” intellectualist approach to religious symbols, “primitive” mentality 

## Functionalist
- **A.R. Radcliffe Brown**: Religion and ritual reinforce the stability of the social order by clearly defining and reinforcing status and roles within the group, and by validating the authority of leaders
	- Symbols -> social structure
- **Bronislaw Malinowski**: social institutions, including “magic,” ritual, and religion, serve a function: namely to serve human needs, both biological and psychological
	- Magical ritual as a response to anxiety, to fill in where human skill cannot guarantee results 
- Malinowski can be seen as **reductionist**; not every aspect of culture fills a specific need or function and cannot always be boiled down as such

> Magic ~ A ritual that is intended to control the outcome of events; baseball rituals can be seen as “magic”

- Magic is a response to anxiety/situations beyond human control
	- Ex: deep sea fishers have rituals/magic that are intended to keep them safe however lagoon/lake fishers tend not to as they are not in danger/have a use for rituals in such a calm environment
- **E.E. Evans-Pritchard**: Studied witchcraft among the Azande of the Upper Nile
	- showed that so-called “primitive” worldviews (e.g. witchcraft) were not “irrational” or opposed to empirical observation
	- Idea of witchcraft as an explanation for events or “why” something happened rather than how it actually happened

## Structuralist
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss**: His fundamental thesis was that **human brains are universally the same throughout our species**, and because our ability to perceive the world is conditioned and restricted by the brain itself, **cultural expression will necessarily be limited by the brain and will obey universal rules (i.e. “structures”)**
- As humans create culture, those cultural forms will necessarily be influenced by certain universal characteristics of the brain itself
- The basic units of human thought are understood to take the form of **binary oppositions** (nature/culture, hot/cold, male/female, etc.), culture will be similarly structured, he thought
- Lévi-Strauss's **The Raw and the Cooking**: raw is to cooked as nature is to culture, unchanged to the changed
	- Strauss's **food triangle**, 3 points: raw, cooked (culture), rotted (nature)

## Cultural Materialist
- **Marvin Harris**: Held that culture is a response to the “practical problems of earth existence"
	- Harris critique: **reduces symbol to function** much like functionalists like **Malinowski**; reductionist

# Symbolic Anthropology
- Symbolic anthropology, unlike the previous approaches, seeks to understand **what symbols mean to people** 
	- Treats cultures as things to be interpreted
	- Focusing on meaningful actions, and the making of meaning through symbols

## Mary Douglas
- **Mary Douglas**: critiqued the folly of 19th century anthropological interpretations of so-called “primitive symbols,” and the (false) distinction these scholars made between “true religion” and “primitive magic;” she critiques reductionist approaches to symbols, such as the materialist approach
- As Mary Douglas points out, our own categories and experience often affect how we view and categorize other people’s symbols
	- Douglas says that instead symbols must be understood in cultural context, and as part of **complex system of signification**

## Clifford Geertz
- He had the view of **culture as a text** and the text being composed of symbols; no one can ever know what it truly is like to be apart of a culture other than their own however we can do our best to try
- Idea that culture is best studied by use of **thick description**; highly detailed and unbiased observation of cultural practices and phenomena to understand a given culture or cultural situation/context
- **"To be human is to be Javanese"**
	- Difference is what unites humans; to be human is to be canadian, indian, egyptian, etc.
### Geertz's Notes on a Balinese Cockfight
- What does the Balinese cockfight symbolize?
	- It serves as a cultural text which embodies, at least a portion of, what the real meaning of “being Balinese” is.
	- The “cock” is a **polysemous symbol** (stands for men, Bali, masculinity, etc.)
	- Not just money that is at stake, but prestige and status
	- Participants in “deep” fights are typically dominant in the society, but fights are not “between” individuals; instead, they are a sublimated type of conflict between kin and social groups
- Cockfight is a way of playing with fire without getting burned, as Geertz puts it
	- It channels aggression and rivalry into a symbolic sphere of “play” (but still one in which you don’t bet against a cock from your own social group)
	- The fight is both a model of, and a model for, the creation the cultural and social world of the Balinese
	- It’s a kind of theatre; it stands for certain relationships but doesn’t transform them; it’s representative, not peformative (i.e. “it’s just a cockfight.”)
- Most importantly, for Geertz, rituals like the Balinese cockfight are texts that can be read; **such rituals are society’s way of speaking to itself about itself**

# Summary
- Symbolic Anthropologists are interested in **meaning**.
	- **Meaning is subjective**, culturally constructed, and irreducible to structures, functions, materiality, history, psychology, etc.

## Symbols Vs. Signs
1. Unlike simple signs, symbols have multiple meanings (i.e. are “polysemic”)
2. Their meanings might be highly motivated (e.g. red means danger) but they are often arbitrary (think e.g. of white for weddings, or pink for girls, or black for formal wear)
3. They have multiple layers of meaning (linguistic, emotional, psychological, etc.)
4. They express complex ideas succinctly and economically (think of the cross in Christianity)
5. Their meanings are culturally particular, not universal (in the West, white is for weddings while in the East it suggests mourning)
6. Finally, symbolic associations—because they can be arbitrary—are not innate, but necessarily learned 

## Approaches to the Study of Symbols
- **EVOLUTIONIST**: Symbols as “primitive” vs. “civilized”
- **FUNCTIONALIST**: Symbols as fulfilling “needs” (either biological, psychological, social, etc.)
- **STRUCTURALIST**: Symbols reflect deep structures (we think in terms of binary opposites, and culture comes to reflect this)
- **MATERIALIST**: Symbols are a response to the  “practical” problems of earthly existence

# Readings Notes: Womack & Geertz

## Womack: "How Symbols are Studied"
- **NOTES PLACEHOLDER**

## Geertz: “The Impact of the Concept of Culture on the Concept of Man”
- What does Geertz mean when he says, “to be human is to be Javanese”?
	- That to be human is to be culturally particular; and this is the core argument of Geertz’s essay

### What is “culture” for Geertz?
- Necessarily particular
- Learned
- Variable
- “accumulated totality of [symbolic] patterns” (1973: 25)
- it is unique to man, and is “best seen not as complexes of concrete behavior patterns—customs, usages, traditions, habits clusters….but as a set of control mechanisms—plans, recipes, rules, instructions…for the governing of behavior” (24)
- it is fundamentally what makes us human, and is, in fact, an “essential condition for our existence.” (25)

### What is a “man” according to Geertz? (pardon the gendered language; for “man” read “human”)
- A (hu)man is an animal necessarily modified by culture
- A (hu)man is inseparable from culture, and culture is inseparable from (hu)man(s)

### What is a human without culture, according to Geertz? And specifically, a human without symbols?
- a (hu)man unmodified by culture does not exist, and could not exist.
- “Undirected by culture patterns—organized systems of significant symbols—man’s behavior would be virtually ungovernable, a mere chaos of pointless acts and exploding emotions, his experience virtually shapeless” (25).
- “Culture, the accumulated totality of such [symbolic] patterns, is not just an ornament of human existence but—the principle basis of its specificity—an essential condition for it” (25).
- Human beings without culture would be “unworkable monstrosities” and “mental basket cases” (26)

### Geertz says that the human is an “unfinished animal.” What does he mean by this?
- To be human is to learn. We are still in the process of being changed by
culture.
- We complete ourselves through culture (27)

### Geertz says that the notion that we “evolved first” (biologically, that is) and then developed culture is a wrong one. Why?
- There was an overlap of one million years or more between the beginning of culture (through tool use, clothing, and perhaps even language!) and the appearance of man as we know him today (25)
- “Men have birthdays; man does not.” (25)
- culture was not an “add-on” for humans, but central to our evolution (26)
	- our capacity for understanding symbols led us to create symbols of even greater complexity
	- our interaction with culture caused our brains to grow; we had to adapt to a new symbolic environment, and larger brains were therefore selected for.
- “By submitting himself to governance by symbolically mediated programs for producing artifacts, organizing social life, or expressing emotions, man determined, if unwittingly, the culminating stages of his own biological destiny. Quite literally, though quite inadvertently, he created himself” (26)

### Geertz problemmatizes both universalism (Enlightenment concept) and cultural relativism (a notion that is common to the social sciences). Why?
- That which is too general is “empty” and describes nothing
- If all men are the “same,” then variation is meaningless; it becomes an aberration that doesn’t tell us about “true” human nature
- Similarly, cultural relativism leads us down a dead-end; both universalism and relativism are two different ways of saying “we are all the same”—a notion that Geertz fundamentally disagrees with

### What is the “Stratigraphic” conception of the relations between biological, psychological, social, and culture factors in human life that Geertz critiques and why?
- Humans are not like onions, comprised of layers (biological, social, psychological, cultural, religious, etc.) that can be easily and neatly separated.
- The notion here is that if we strip away all the institutional trappings of culture we will be left with a kind of “natural” or “primal” man; but as Geertz points out, you can’t have human beings without culture.

### Why is the attempt to come up with so-called “cultural universals” doomed to fail, in Geertz’s view?
- Human institutions—such as family, trade, education, religion, marriage—cannot be reduced to one “underlying human requirement” rooted in biology or universal “human nature”. This is because all these institutions serve a multiplicity of social, psychological, and biological needs.
- To reduce a cultural form or social institution to a “universal need” is akin to saying that marriage is a “mere reflex of the social need to reproduce” or that dining customs are “a reflex of metabolic necessities” (22). Absurd, no?

### What is the function of symbols for human beings, in the view of Geertz?
- Thinking is not just what is “in our head” but is a “traffic in…significant symbols—words for the most part but also gestures, drawings, musical sounds, mechanical devices like clocks, or natural objects like jewels—anything, in fact…that [is] used to impose meaning upon experience” (24).
- “Man is so in need of such symbolic sources of illumination to find his bearings in the world because the non-symbolic sort that are constitutionally ingrained in his body cast so diffused a light” (24). In other words, genetics actually have very little to do with our day-to-day behaviors. Instead, symbols guide us to act.
- Symbols direct our existence; they are the key that links the “genetic” or “biological” to the cultural (27); see examples on right column of page 27, or the biological vs. cultural
- Symbols are not “mere expressions, instrumentalities, or correlates of our biological, psychological, and social existence; they are prerequisites of it.” (27)

### What is it, then, to be human, according to Geertz?
- “not to be Everyman; it is to be a particular kind of man” (29)
- “One of the most significant facts about us may finally be that we all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but end in the end having only lived one” (24)
- “humanity is as various in its essence as it is in its expression” (19)
- “As culture shaped us as a single species—and is no doubt still shaping us—so too it shapes us as separate individuals. This, neither an unchanging subculture self nor an established cross-cultural consensus, is what we really have in common” (28).
- Culture doesn’t make us all the same, it makes us into individuals. (29)
- to understand human nature, the “road to the general, to the revelatory simplicities of science lies through a concern with the particular” (29).
- We cannot locate “Man” with a capital “m” without first taking account of “man” with a lowercase “m”
- In other words, to understand the general, we must understand the particular, not the other way around!
