# ANTH221 - Week 3

- Cows are **ritually pure** & pigs are **ritually unpure**
- Do symbols need to make sense: they make sense to people who believe them; outsiders have to make sense of the symbol

# A Symbolic Response to Materialism
- Both **Douglas** and **Korom** are engaged in a critique of **CULTURAL MATERIALISM**
	-an approach—spearheaded by **Marvin Harris** in the 1960s and 1970s— that reduces **SYMBOL** to **FUNCTION**

# Mary Douglas
- Douglas is a British anthropologist and student of Evans-Pritchard who studied Lele religious rituals in the (Belgian) Congo. 
- She is most famous for her analysis of the food taboos of Leviticus (i.e. the Old Testament) and her work Purity and Danger
- Considered a follower of Émile Durkheim and a proponent of structuralist analysis, with a strong interest in comparative religion
- She is also considered a symbolic anthropologist

# Taboo
> Taboo ~ Religious restriction

- Taboos might constitute a ban on touching, eating, speaking to, or seeing someone or something
- **Mary Douglas** points out that **“taboo” behavior is highly meaningful** and part of a complex system of signification

> “To the outsider the taboo is irrational, to the believer its rightness needs no explaining.” (Douglas 1979: 68)

- As Douglas points out, taboos serve many functions in our daily lives
	- They set up necessary boundaries that we, as humans, need to function
	- We may have an ideology that “total freedom” (of the body, mind, etc.) is an ideal state, but Douglas points out that such freedom would slow us down if not paralyze us (1979: 73)
	- **Taboos “inject order” into life**

# The Abominations of Leviticus
- Distinction between **clean/dirty vs. pure/unpure**
	- Pure/purity has deep symbolic meaning; **ritually pure vs. materially “dirty”**

> Abomination ~ Something so extremely taboo they cannot be touched or handled

# Readings Notes: Unclean Pigs & Sacred Cows
- From the **materialist perspective**, human behavior and worldviews are shaped by practical responses to environmental, biological, medical, ecological, or technological realities and needs (i.e. material domains).
	- “Human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence”—Marvin Harris (1979: xv)
		- Ex: the cow is holy in Hinduism because it is economically more useful alive than dead
			- Critiques: the cow is a very important symbol in Hinduism within a long and rich textual tradition. Not all useful things are holy! (Can you think of some examples?)
- From the **idealist perspective**, culture and religion can be understood to be “in our heads”. In other words, ideas (beliefs and symbols) are what shape our worldviews.
	- Taboos give order to our lives; without limits or boundaries there would be chaos. “To the outsider the taboo is irrational, to the believer its rightness needs no explaining.”—Mary Douglas (1979: 68)
		- Ex: Food taboos of the Old Testament are not irrational or arbitrary but symbolically important; the Old Testament concept of “holiness” (as ordered, complete, set apart, never confused) helps us understand them
- Idea of **pigs as "unclean"**: A pig has cloven hooves but does not chew cud like other domesticated livestock (sheep, cows, goats). Note that the Old Testament doesn't mention pigs being (materially) dirty; rather that they are symbolically or “ceremonially” ‘unclean.’
