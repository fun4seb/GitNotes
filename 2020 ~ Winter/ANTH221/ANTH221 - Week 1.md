# ANTH221 - Week 1

# In Today's Class
- Overview of the course and its aims
- Introduction to symbols
- Group activity on colors

# What is a Symbol?
- A symbol has alot more content and meaning than most people realize
- Symbols are not just things we see, for example:
	- Body language is symbolic
	- Rituals performed have symbolic meaning
	- Foods have symbolic meanings such as tumeric in Indian culture
- Looking at something purely from a utilitarian point of view to understand why certain things exist as powerful symbols fails to see the big picture

# No Such Thing is "Just a Symbol"
- Symbols have alot of power over people, this is seen as people die over symbols such as "dying for the flag", they dont literally die for the flag but they die for what the flag represents as a symbol

# Defining Symbols
- Symbols express complex ideas succinctly and economically

> Polysemic ~ Capability of having several possible meanings, in this case symbols many times have several equally relavant meanings (**WILL BE ON EXAMS**)

> Multivalant ~ Effects someone in many different ways

# Symbolism
- Symbolism at its base involves the use and awareness of signs
- Context of symbols is important, hand signs mean different things in different places, lack of hair could hold different meanings within different situations and cultures

## Importance of Symbolism
- **Symbolism crucially involves the capacity for ABSTRACTION**

## Symbols Vs. Signs
- Symbols are the stuff of culture; cannot have culture without symbols
- Humans are the only animal that communicate with symbolic meanings while animals communicate only with signs
	- Ex: Seagull chicks innately know to peck at mothers **red** spot on beak as a sign to indicate hunger while humans may associate **red** with love, death, anger, fire, passion, etc.
- Unlike simple signs, **symbols have multiple meanings**

## Why Study Symbols?
- Important to understanding human culture and society
- Something that is highly naturalized; we take them for granted despite having sometimes complex meanings

## Example: Symbolism of Color
- Different colors as an example have different meanings and interpretations that may varry across cultures. Some examples include:
	- Red: Love, death, anger, fire, passion
	- Green: Luck, go, envy, environmentalism, sickness, money, fertility
	- Yellow: Cowardice, caution, friendship
	- Blue: Sadness, police, calmness
- Colors show how **symbolism is not UNIVERSAL**

# Nature & Culture
- Humans still have natural instincts, requirments, etc. However, **culture also tends to convert those natural elements into symbolic forms**
	- Ex: Biological sex is converted into a system of cultural categorization, **gender**, which varies across cultures
