# ANTH221 - Week 4 -7

- Key idea of lecture: **Does culture have to “make sense”? Do religious symbols need to have a “rational” basis to be meaningful?**

# Week 4: 'Dirt' as "Matter Out of Place"

# A Symbolic Response to Materialism
- Key question: **What role does the material play in determining cultural and religious symbols and their meanings?**
- Ex: food taboos in Judaism and Hinduism
	- A materialist approach asks if pork is non-Kosher because pigs roll in mud? Are cows taboo to eat for Hindus because they are more “useful” alive?
	- A symbolic approach focuses more on meaning than materiality
		- E.g. “holiness” as a symbol of “completeness” helps us understand the taboo against pork in Judaism, and Hindu mythology helps us to understand the crucial role of cows within Hinduism, as maternal symbols of abundance and fertility
- NOTE: **the distinction between modern and primitive is irrelavent because all humans abide by the same rules, however in primitive culture patterning works with greater force**

# Materialism vs. Idealism
- Are culture and religion “in our heads” or simply practical responses to environmental, biological, medical,  ecological, technological, etc., realities (i.e. material domains)
	- What makes people have the ideas they have?
		- Idealism = ideas are what causes behaviour rather than…
		- Materialism = materialist concerns are what causes behaviour
- There has been a long standing debate in anthropology over whether behavior and worldview are caused by pragmatic considerations (materialism) or whether ideas cause behavior (idealism)
	- The answer lies somewhere in between, but many anthropologists fall on opposing ends of the materialist/idealist theoretical spectrum (e.g. Harris vs. Douglas)
- **Idealism** views culture in its mental and symbolic forms
	- Hegel was interested in IDEAS as the primary motor driving history and cultural change
		- His concept of the dialectic was hugely influential in Western thought
			- THESIS/problem
			- ANTITHESIS/opposition to the problem
			- SYNTHESIS/solution
		- Social progress is the result of the “labor of reason” in history, which operates according to a dialectical process
- **Materialism** tends to view culture in terms of overt, observable behavioral patterns; technology, environmental and other (material) factors are primary and causal
	- Karl Marx was heavily influenced by the work of Hegel, but his approach (“historical” or “dialectical materialism”) was different; for Marx, it was not so much ideas but the material that were most important as the motor of history
		- For Marx, “ideas” (culture, religion, roles, ritual, philosophy, etc.) form a “superstructure” that emerges from the material base or infrastructure of a society
			- The base comprises the forces and relations of production—employer–employee work conditions, the technical division of labor, and property relations—into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life
- **Cultural materialism** as an anthropological approach was heavily influenced by Marxist theory, but differs in some important ways
	- Cultural materialists believe that technological and economic aspects play the primary role in shaping a society. 
	- Cultural materialism aims to understand the effects of technological, economic and demographic factors on molding societal structure and superstructure through strictly scientific methods.
	- The notion that “human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence” (Harris 2001 [1979]: xv)
	- As stated by Marvin Harris, cultural materialism strives to  “create a pan-human science of society whose findings can be accepted on logical and evidentiary grounds by the pan-human community" (Harris 1979: xii).

## Superstructure
- **Superstructure = "realm of ideas"**

![alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_and_superstructure#/media/File:Base-superstructure_Dialectic.png "Superstructure Diagram")

## Cultural Materialism ~ "Material is what drives ideas"
- Coined by Marvin Harris in his 1968 text, “cultural materialism” is the approach he is most known for
	- Harris was influenced by Marxist dialectical and historical materialism, which was in turn influenced by the Hegelian dialectic
		- Cultural materialism represents a shift from a focus on IDEAS as the motor of history and cultural change to the MATERIAL
		- For cultural materialists, the infrastructure (defined as a society’s relationship to the environment, material conditions, etc.) is the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture.
- **Cultural materialists believe that technological and economic aspects play the primary role in shaping a society**

### A Symbolic Critique
- Mary Douglas uses the example of “dirt” to critique the cultural materialist approach
	- Material vs. ritual pollution
	- our concept of “dirt” in the West is one of “matter out of place”
		- We may think that our conceptions of what is “dirty” are “purely” scientific, but in actually they are just as SYMBOLIC as other cultural constructs which understand “dirt” in terms of ritual pollution
		- Our concept of “dirt” may not be couched in a religious idiom but that’s really the only difference
- **Conclusion: our concept of “dirt” may not be couched in a religious idiom but that’s really the only difference**

# Do Symbols Need to "Make Sense"
- Symbols don’t need to “make sense” to be meaningful, at the same time, they aren’t “nonsense,” but can be understood as part of complex systems of signification. They may have practical “uses” or “functions,” but their multiple meanings should not be reduced to these.

# Franz Boas and “Secondary Rationalizations”
- Franz Boas is credited with invented our modern anthropological concept of “culture”
- He maintained that (contrary to Tylor, e.g.) that culture is largely **learned** and **unconscious**
- Enculturation occurs through habituation and thus acts through **unconscious processes rather than rational deliberation**
- Though culture is largely transmitted unconsciously, **secondary rationalizations** are often offered to explain cultural values.
	- Cultural materialism (which includes medical materialism) provides the basis for many ‘secondary rationalizations’…
- **Key point of slide: cultural materialism (which includes medical materialism) provides the basis for many ‘secondary rationalizations**
	- This is problematic from a postmodern perspective; have to be careful about our impulse to rationalize complex cultural phenomena scientifically
	- Idea of coming up with secondary reasoning to describe something in a often reductionist way (such as saying people put christmas trees in their house because they filter the air)

# Symbology and “Pollution” as a Relative Concept
- The concept of **“respect pollution”** helps us understand how Hindu notions of purity/pollution are part of a complex symbolic ordering.

> Douglas cites EB Harper: ...Cow dung, like the dung of any other animal, is intrinsically impure and can cause defilement – in fact it will defile a god; but it is pure relative to a mortal...

## "Respect Pollution"
- Basically the idea of **purposely polluting/defiling yourself** to show respect or **devotion to a structurally superior individual** such as shaking their hand or Indian ritual of drinking liquid used to bathe ones feet; polluting something from a ritual standpoint
- Douglas gives the example of “respect pollution” in Hindu ritual to illustrate her argument that such rituals are predicated not on a “lack of hygiene” but a complex symbolic ordering
	- So called “respect pollution” **involves intentionally defiling oneself to show devotion to a structurally superior individual** (elders, gurus, gods, etc.)
	- Such examples of “respect pollution” contradict the assertion of Robertson Smith that “primitives” had no concept of hygiene; in fact, for the Hindus being observed by Harper, the concepts of purity and pollution were extremely well-elaborated; only because of this fact did the ritual (in essence, a **violation of a taboo**) obtain its power.
- In her chapter **“Secular Defilement”**, Mary Douglas argues that we must not conflate (material) “cleanliness” with (symbolic or ritual) “purity”

## Hindu notions of “pure” and “impure
- According to Louis Dumont, “caste” Hindus are regularly “polluted” (ritually or symbolically, not necessarily literally) by life events
	- What Dumont calls **“THE ORGANIC ASPECTS OF HUMAN LIFE”** — birth, death, menstruation, etc.
		- For such polluting events, BATHING, and WATER in particular, are cleansing and ritually purifying
		- Even more cleansing than WATER, are the five sacred products of the COW
	- Lower-caste Hindus, such as the Shudras and the Dalits, are understood to be in a constant state of “pollution” or ritual impurity, a state that cannot be “washed off”

# Dirt as "Matter out of Place"
- Mary Douglas, in her famous work Purity and Danger, discusses the notion of dirt as “matter out of place”
She points out that we in the West often think that our behaviors—especially with respect to dirt—are based entirely in empirical science, and especially, notions of “hygiene”
Often, our notions of what is “dirty” have little to do with material “dirt” but instead with stuff that is in a place that it doesn’t belong; that which doesn’t obey ordinary limits and boundaries—in other words, that which violates **taboos**...
- Dirt is a “residual category” (Douglas, 37)
It is that which “confuses” or “contradicts” our “cherished classifications and categories” (37); it’s the leftover matter that doesn’t fit; it if that which refuses “order” (36) **much like pigs who are impure due having cloven feet and not chewing cud**
- Idea of **western hypocrisy** as we critique other cultural practices for being unscientific yet in western societies we have just as much purely symbolic cultural practices that are not grounded in science or at least not primarily.

# In Conclusion
- It is not, as early anthropologists had (wrongly) assumed, that Hindus have no concept of “hygiene”
- In fact, it is precisely because Hindus have such a well-articulated and highly developed ideology of purity and “cleanliness” that otherwise defiling actions have such symbolic and ritual power
- As Mary Douglas argues, the distinction between “religious” and “secular” kinds of “dirt” is not clear-cut.
The only real difference between the symbolic “dirt” of “primitives” and “moderns,” she says, is that Westerners do not explain their own kinds of “symbolic” dirt using a religious idiom.
- **Taboos** — regarding purity and impurity — are usually symbolic
	- They are not dependent on physical circumstances; they are integrating, social mechanisms—not simple responses to economic or ecological pressures
	- This is not to say that taboos don’t interpret the material or the biological in a symbolic way—but they cannot always be reduced to a material (or biological/pathogenic) basis

# Week 5: Color Cognition ~ Biologically Pre-determined or Culturally Particular?

## A Symbolic Response to Materialism
- Our case studies showed that symbolic meanings (from food taboos, to religious symbols, and even the concept of “dirt”) are not reducible to the material.
- We saw how category confusion (“taboo” violations), and the need to keep things “separate” is at the base of many of these symbolic distinctions, specifically the food taboos, as well as notions of “dirt”
- We saw how “unclean” or “impure” is not always a material distinction; these are forms of contamination that cannot be seen or “measured”

## A Symbolic Critique
- As Mary Douglas uses the example of “dirt” to critique the cultural materialist approach
- material vs. ritual pollution
- our concept of “dirt” in the West is one of “matter out of place”
- we may think that our conceptions of what is “dirty” are “purely” scientific, but in actually they are just as SYMBOLIC as other cultural constructs which understand “dirt” in terms of ritual pollution
- our concept of “dirt” may not be couched in a religious idiom but that’s really the only difference

## Dirt as “Matter Out of Place”
- Mary Douglas, in her famous work Purity and Danger, discusses the notion of dirt as “matter out of place”
- She points out that we in the West often think that our behaviors—especially with respect to dirt—are based entirely in empirical science, and especially, notions of “hygiene” Often, our notions of what is “dirty” have little to do with material “dirt” but instead with stuff that is in a place that it doesn’t belong; that which doesn’t obey ordinary limits and boundaries—in other words, that which violates taboos….

### “Dirt is Matter Out of Place”
- Dirt is a “residual category” (Douglas, 37)
- It is that which “confuses” or “contradicts” our “cherished classifications and categories” (37); it’s the leftover matter that doesn’t fit; it if that which refuses “order” (36)

## In Conclusion
- As Mary Douglas argues, the distinction between “religious” and “secular” kinds of “dirt” is not clear-cut.
- The only real difference between the symbolic “dirt” of “primitives” and “moderns,” she says, is that Westerners do not explain their own kinds of “symbolic” dirt using a religious idiom.
- CATEGORIES ARE SYMBOLIC CONSTRUCTS.
- This does not mean that categories do not have a material reality, simply that material “reality” is interpreted by humans in symbolic ways.

## IS OUR EXPERIENCE OF COLOR BIOLOGICALLY PRE-DETERMINED OR CULTURALLY PARTICULAR? ~ What about colors?: 
- Aren’t those “universal” symbols?
- In other words, don’t we all perceive (at least a minimal set of) colors?
- Yes, we do perceive colors, but the “colors” thatwe see are by no means the same
- This is a feature not of biology, but of culture and, specifically, language
- “Color is in the eye of the beholder”
- There is nothing wrong with the Himbas’ eyes
- They can perceive the same wavelengths that anyone else does, but they name them differently
- If we do not name a color, we do not readily perceive that particular distinction….

## color terminologies, cross culturally
- the simplest system describes which colors?
	- black and white
- three color systems add which additional color?
	- red
- In the Torres Straits (Haddon) expedition of 1989, W.H.R. Rivers famously discovered that the Papuans did not have a word for “blue.” Instead they used the same term for the brilliant blue sea or sky as they did for the deepest black
	- **Why is this?**

# Week 6: SACRED - PROFANE, LEFT - RIGHT & FEMALE - MALE , NATURE - CULTURE?

## Weeks 5 & 6
- THE SYMBOLIC MEDIATION OF BIOLOGY
- In other words, what are those aspects of our daily lives that we tend to think are determined by biology or “nature,” but which, upon closer inspection, actually turn out to be largely symbolic constructs that are culturally particular.
	- Examples include:
		- COLOR PERCEPTION
		- RIGHT HAND VS. LEFT HAND
		- FEMALE: MALE :: NATURE:CULTURE?
- **everything we sense and experience is interpreted in a categorically cultural way.**

## Symbols for Love
- The “heart” is not the universal symbol for love; different organs may be associated with different emotions
	- In Vietnamese, the “stomach” is described as being the seat of one’s feelings 
		- "from the bottom of my stomach" (từ đáy lòng), "lose one's stomach" (mất lòng), "good-stomached (kindhearted) (tốt bụng), etc.
	- Turkish locates feelings of love in the liver; there is the expression “My liver, my soul”
	- Tamil uses the term “manasu” or “heart/mind” to describe that place where feelings reside
- **in the west, heart = love**
- **Not every culture practices kissing; it is not a human universal, but culturally particular and learned**

### Contesting symbols for love
- idea of hating the industry of love and love as a construct to control; cultural form that threatens a traditional cultural order.

## Symbolic Dichotomies: Right vs. Left
- Just as color cognition is revealed to be cultural and symbolic constructs (rather than simply “natural” ways of experiencing the world and human relationships) the same can be said for the right/left distinction, and the relationship between sex and gender…

> We tend to think of the “preponderance” of the right hand as owing entirely to biology... But as Hertz shows, our overwhelming preference for the right hand owes more to culture than to biology, to symbols rather than “nature”... The “preponderance” of the right hand, Hertz argues, is a symbolic distinction rather than a natural one.

- **Right/left:** Hertz says that this binary is so all-consuming, man’s body can hardly escape it:
	- “If organic asymmetry had not existed, it would have had to be invented.”
- **symbolic, not natural distinction**
- How is this bias towards the right hand revealed in language?
	- “Right hand man”, right meaning correct, “two left feet”; **Right = good, left = bad**

### Right Hand Bias Reflected in Language
- In many European languages, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". 
- In English, the word “right” doesn’t just mean the direction; it carries many other (positive) connotations:
	- Correct, just, fair, proper, good, upright, righteous, virtuous, moral, ethical, honorable, honest, lawful, legal, etc.

#### English
- in English, “left-handed” carries the connotation of clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, etc. 
	- A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning.
	- Someone who has “two left feet” is considered clumsy

#### French
- In French, gauche means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while droit(e) (cognate to English “direct” and related to "adroit,” which means to be skillful at something) means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". 
	- The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. The Latin adjective “sinister” means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister.”

#### Other Examples of Right Hand Bias in Daily Practices
- Shaking hands
- Oath-taking
- Eating
- Pledging allegiance
- **Religious symbolism**
	- Angel over the right shoulder, jesus right palm up signifying blessing, mercy, etc. & left palm down meaning the opposite, South Asian gesture of blessing within iconography with right hand up

- **Gender dimensions:** As Hertz points out, in many cultures the **left is associated with the female** and the **right with the male**; Hindu iconography reflects this commonly

### Culture, Not Biology
- The “preponderance” of the right hand, says Hertz, **does not reflect a biological predisposition**, but rather is due to the power of culture (culture > biology in this case)

> “Can one believe that a slight difference of degree in the physical strength of the two hands could be enough to account for such a trenchant and profound heterogeneity?” (Hertz 103)

## THE SYMBOLIC MEDIATION OF BIOLOGY ~ Relationship Between Sex & Gender
- The way that certain behaviors become gendered is often very unconscious to us.
	- In other words, **gender is a social construct that is highly naturalized**
- We think that gender differences are “innate” or “natural” but they are more often than not **culturally constructed**

### Gender ideology
- in order to be legitimized and reproduced, gender must rest on some form of cultural understanding about the “nature” or men and women
- cultural systems of ideas and thought (i.e. “ideologies”) explain and legitimate cultural expectations about gender
- biological differences may form a basis for gender distinctions but culture is the means by which biological differences are INTERPRETED in the form of GENDER
	- another example of **SYMBOLS mediating BIOLOGY**
- **despite there being differences between sexes, the emergence of a hierarchy (ranking of the sexes) is entirely culturally constructed**

## Nature/Culture
- The nature/culture dichotomy has been foundational for anthropology theory
- Early anthropologists sought to understand human society as negotiating a perceived tension between culture, as a social entity, and nature, as a bio-physical entity. 
- It also refers to nature vs. nurture; how much of our day-to-day experience as humans is “natural” or “biological” and how much is “cultural” or “symbolic”?
- In the 1960s and 1970s, the debate was extended and the dichotomy examined through a **feminist lens**
	- Sherry Ortner (1972) famously asked “is female to male as nature is to culture?”
		- Ortner wanted to know why it is that **“woman” is understood to be closer to the natural world?** And how does this nearly universal association help us to understand women’s oppression?
		- interested in the relationship between sex and gender, and how this relates to nature/culture

### Feminist Approaches to Nature/Culture
- Sherry Ortner (b. 1941): **nature/culture -> feminine/masculine**
- The relationship  between women and the act of reproduction explains the feminine association with nature. **The feminine association with nature forms the basis for gender hierarchies**

### What gender differences do we assume to be “natural”? ~ How is gender naturalized?
- Ex: **"Women are hormonal"**, what does this really mean?
	- “Pre-menstrual” women in other cultures don’t necessarily crave chocolate.
	- In the USA, pregnant women are said to crave “pickles and ice cream” while in Sri Lanka, pregnant Sinhalese women are said to crave tamarind, ginger beer, and and dried fish!
	- What do we make of the fact that **even our “cravings” are symbolic?**
- **Proposition: Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) is a social construct**

## Cultural Construction of the “Hormonal Woman”
- “Studies of the relationship between mood and hormonal changes have focused on women's (rather than men's) cycles and in the process have discovered the hormonal disease of premenstrual syndrome.
- **This syndrome is characterized by both physical pain and mood disturbances and has been attributed by the biomedical research community to hormonal imbalances in the women who suffer from it.**
- The syndrome has been used to explain a host of emotions ranging from irritability and mood swings to depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

### Feminist Critique of PMS Syndrome
- A number of feminist critiques have pointed out the weakness of the evidence for this syndrome. Assessment of women's mood is usually based on retrospective self-report via questionnaires (one popular version being titled the “Menstrual Distress Questionnaire"), which allow women to draw on cultural knowledge about the relation between gender, emotion, and hormones.
- Conversely, studies that disguise the purposes of the questionnaire show no significant premenstrual mood changes. The putative therapeutic effects of hormone injections are taken as primary evidence of the female hormonal basis for mood changes, but these studies have not been “double-blind." As Whatley argues, this biomedical discourse on emotions and gender may cause us to ignore the fact that our premenstrual mood changes . . . may also correlate more closely to a monthly cycle of low bank balances than of hormonal fluctuations

## "Why Men Never Remember Anything"
- Another example of the **naturalization of gender differences** is memory formation
- Melissa Dahl in New York Magazine (19/9/14) discusses studies which seek to understand **why women tend to have more detailed memories than men**
	- “Women are indeed better at recalling memories, especially autobiographical ones. **Girls and women tend to recall these memories faster and with more specific details**, and some studies have demonstrated that these memories tend to be more accurate, too, when compared to those of boys and men.”
- Could be down to early childhood development, **how do parents talk to daughters vs. sons?**
	- Without even realizing it, parents have gendered expectations of the ways boys and girls communicate; we tend to ask girls more detailed questions about their experiences and how they felt about them, whereas we don’t ask the same sorts of questions of boys
	- The result is that girls form different connections in their brains, because certain behaviors and forms of recall are being elicited and reinforced in their environment.

## In Conclusion
- The question is not whether there are biological differences between males and females; **it is clear that there are differences!**
- The question is why such biological differences would necessarily entail a hierarchy; **the answer to this question is gender, which is a symbolic construct through which we interpret sex differences**
- For Sherry Ortner, a **gender hierarchy arises from the symbolic association of females with nature**

# Week 7: Ritual Symbols, Rites of Passage

## “Ritual”
- Rituals are necessarily symbolic, but they also have performative effects—meaning they do things. They transform wine into the blood of Jesus in Catholic churches, or they make an individual suffer pain through a pin-prick in the case of witchcraft. They are instrumental.

### Defining “Ritual”
- The problem of defining “ritual” (does it have to be religious? what about secular rituals? “magical” rituals, etc.) can be helped by picking apart processes of “ritualization”—in other words thinking of ritual as a linked set of practices and effects more or less present in any given case.

## Ritualization
> Ritualization ~ 

- Stylized, repetitive, stereotyped
- Scripted, formulaic (but still distinct from
theatre)
- Takes place in a sacred space/time
- Has some (often supernatural) effect, is a form of symbolic action

## Instrumentality of Ritual
- The pervasiveness of ritual is seen in daily rituals performed to accomplish some goal.
- Rituals do things. They transform wine into the blood of Jesus in Catholic churches, or they make an individual suffer pain through a pin-prick in the case of a voodoo doll. They are instrumental.

## Victor Turner (1920-1983)
- Studied rituals, symbols, and rites of passage,
especially the concept of liminality
- His primary fieldwork was among the Ndembu
of Zambia

### Victor Turner on “Ritual”
- Rituals are “composed of symbols” (Turner,
1100)
- A ritual is a “stereotyped sequence of activities
involving gestures, words, and objects,
performed in a sequestered place, and
designed to influence preternatural entities or
forces on behalf of the actor’s goals or
interests” (Turner, 1100)
- **There are many different kinds of rituals**
	- Seasonal
	- Contingent (in response to crisis)
	- Divinatory
	- “Life-crisis” ceremonies (i.e. rites of passage)
	- Birth, puberty, marriage, death, etc.
- “The ritual symbol is the smallest unit of ritual
which still retains the specific properties of ritual
behavior” (Turner 1100)
- The ritual symbol has many attributes:
	- **Multiple meanings**
	- **It unifies** apparently disparate “significata” or meanings
	- **It “condenses” many “ideas, relations between things, actions, interactions, and transactions”** — all of which are simultaneously represented by the “symbol vehicle”
	- It “polarizes significata,” meaning that **it can symbolize two disparate and seemingly opposed things at the same time.**

## The Mudyi Tree
- For Turner, the mudyi tree (Diplorrhyncus Mossambicensis) of the Ndembu tribe is the ritual symbol par excellence
	- It is the ritual center for Ndembu communities, the site around which ritual occurs and cultural meaning is produced
	- Girls are placed at the foot of the tree in puberty rituals
	- At its “normative” pole: it stands for womanhood, motherhood, the mother-child bond, a matri-lineage, matriliny itself, the process of learning “women’s wisdom,” and all values and virtues inherent in the various relationships controlled by matrilineal descent
	- At its “sensory pole” the same symbol stands for breasts milk (as the tree exudes a white latex), breasts, the slender body of the novice, etc.

## Ritual Effects
- Ritualized behaviors are useful for creating group cohesion, or communitas.
- They give the conception of control, especially at sites where we have a feeling of a lack of control (sites of anxiety, of chance, etc.). (Malinowski’s view of ritual.)
- They act upon things through symbolic connections. (Frazer’s concept of ‘magic’.)

## Ritual Process
- special kinds of symbols have a power not just to stand for things, but to do things
- One of the important ways in which symbols can be understood to act is through ritual
	- recall that ritual is: a sequence of actions involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a particular place, according to set sequence, and having symbolic and performative effects (meaning they both stand for things and do things)

## Key Example: RITES OF PASSAGE
- **What are “rites of passage”?** Van Gennep defined them as “rites which accompany every change of place, state, social position, and age.”
- In other words, a rite of passage is a ritual that marks an individual’s (or group’s) transformation from one social state to another.

- Victor Turner was influenced by the work of French anthropologist and folklorist, Arnold Van Gennep (1873-1957) 
- Van Gennep was most noted for his work Les rites des passage
	- This work includes his vision of rites of passage rituals as being divided into three phases:
		1. Préliminaire (preliminary)
		2. Liminaire (liminality) (the stage that most interested Victor Turner), and
		3. Postliminaire (post-liminality).

### Van Gennep’s Les Rites des Passage
- Van Gennep showed that all rites of passage or “transition” are marked by three phases:
	1. **separation**, “which comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group...from an earlier fixed point in the social structure” (Turner 1969: 94)
	2. **liminal period**, an intervening state in which the characteristics of the subject are ambiguous.
	3. **reaggregation or reincorporation** in which the rite of passage is completed, and the new rites and obligations of the individual are clearly defined

## The “Liminal” State
- Of the phases that Van Gennep described, Turner was most interested in that of the **“liminal” state**
	- “liminal” derives from the Latin word līmen, meaning "a threshold”
- Van Gennep was the first to develop the concept of **“liminality,”** a concept that was then taken up by Victor Turner
	- “liminality” is now a concept that has a much wider application beyond that of describing rituals
- liminal states mark **the “limbo” period between an old identity being left behind and a new identity being achieved** through the rite of passage
- During liminal periods...
	- Social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved
	- Identities are very fluid
	- A previous social order is dissolved, allowing for new social institutions and statuses to be created

### Examples of Liminal States
- Liminality has both spatial and temporal dimensions, and can be applied to...
	- Individuals
		- Momentary events (births, deaths, divorce, illness) or
		- Individualized rites of passage (baptism, puberty rituals, etc.)
		- Over a period of time (teenage years)
		- For the entire lifespan (monkhood)
	- Groups
		- Momentary events (graduation ceremonies)
		- Over a period of time (going to college, university)
		- For the entire lifespan (immigrant groups, or liminal groups [often considered holy as well as dangerous])
	- Societies
		- Momentary (natural disasters, plagues, Carnivals [hierarchies disappear], revolutions
		- over a period of time (prolonged wars)

## Liminality and “Communitas”
- Turner was very interested communitas as a characteristic of people experiencing liminality together.
- For Turner, “communitas” is a feeling of great social equality, solidarity, and togetherness.
- For Turner, “communitas” offers a “blend of lowliness and sacredness, of homegeneity and comradeship”
- “Communitas” — as a relatively unstructured and egalitarian form of community experience—contrasts sharply with social structure (a “hierarchical system of politico-legal economic positions” with many forms of separation between people)

### “Communitas” vs. Social Structure
- For Turner, **communitas** is the antithesis of social structure:
	- it emerges where social structure is not;
	- it is spontaneous, immediate, concrete, the “here and now”
	- it is existential, potentiality
	- it is multivocal
	- it characterizes art and religion
- **Social structure**, on the other hand:
	- is abstract, rule-governed, institutionalized
	- is cognitive, and consists of legal and political structures
	- is hierarchical and status-oriented
