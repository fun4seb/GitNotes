# ANTH221 - Week 4

- Key idea of lecture: **Does culture have to “make sense”? Do religious symbols need to have a “rational” basis to be meaningful?**

# A Symbolic Response to Materialism
- Key question: **What role does the material play in determining cultural and religious symbols and their meanings?**
- Ex: food taboos in Judaism and Hinduism
	- A materialist approach asks if pork is non-Kosher because pigs roll in mud? Are cows taboo to eat for Hindus because they are more “useful” alive?
	- A symbolic approach focuses more on meaning than materiality
		- E.g. “holiness” as a symbol of “completeness” helps us understand the taboo against pork in Judaism, and Hindu mythology helps us to understand the crucial role of cows within Hinduism, as maternal symbols of abundance and fertility
- NOTE: **the distinction between modern and primitive is irrelavent because all humans abide by the same rules, however in primitive culture patterning works with greater force**

# Materialism vs. Idealism
- Are culture and religion “in our heads” or simply practical responses to environmental, biological, medical,  ecological, technological, etc., realities (i.e. material domains)
	- What makes people have the ideas they have?
		- Idealism = ideas are what causes behaviour rather than…
		- Materialism = materialist concerns are what causes behaviour
- There has been a long standing debate in anthropology over whether behavior and worldview are caused by pragmatic considerations (materialism) or whether ideas cause behavior (idealism)
	- The answer lies somewhere in between, but many anthropologists fall on opposing ends of the materialist/idealist theoretical spectrum (e.g. Harris vs. Douglas)
- **Idealism** views culture in its mental and symbolic forms
	- Hegel was interested in IDEAS as the primary motor driving history and cultural change
		- His concept of the dialectic was hugely influential in Western thought
			- THESIS/problem
			- ANTITHESIS/opposition to the problem
			- SYNTHESIS/solution
		- Social progress is the result of the “labor of reason” in history, which operates according to a dialectical process
- **Materialism** tends to view culture in terms of overt, observable behavioral patterns; technology, environmental and other (material) factors are primary and causal
	- Karl Marx was heavily influenced by the work of Hegel, but his approach (“historical” or “dialectical materialism”) was different; for Marx, it was not so much ideas but the material that were most important as the motor of history
		- For Marx, “ideas” (culture, religion, roles, ritual, philosophy, etc.) form a “superstructure” that emerges from the material base or infrastructure of a society
			- The base comprises the forces and relations of production—employer–employee work conditions, the technical division of labor, and property relations—into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life
- **Cultural materialism** as an anthropological approach was heavily influenced by Marxist theory, but differs in some important ways
	- Cultural materialists believe that technological and economic aspects play the primary role in shaping a society. 
	- Cultural materialism aims to understand the effects of technological, economic and demographic factors on molding societal structure and superstructure through strictly scientific methods.
	- The notion that “human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence” (Harris 2001 [1979]: xv)
	- As stated by Marvin Harris, cultural materialism strives to  “create a pan-human science of society whose findings can be accepted on logical and evidentiary grounds by the pan-human community" (Harris 1979: xii).

## Superstructure
- **Superstructure = "realm of ideas"**

## Cultural Materialism ~ "Material is what drives ideas"
- Coined by Marvin Harris in his 1968 text, “cultural materialism” is the approach he is most known for
	- Harris was influenced by Marxist dialectical and historical materialism, which was in turn influenced by the Hegelian dialectic
		- Cultural materialism represents a shift from a focus on IDEAS as the motor of history and cultural change to the MATERIAL
		- For cultural materialists, the infrastructure (defined as a society’s relationship to the environment, material conditions, etc.) is the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture.
- **Cultural materialists believe that technological and economic aspects play the primary role in shaping a society**

### A Symbolic Critique
- Mary Douglas uses the example of “dirt” to critique the cultural materialist approach
	- Material vs. ritual pollution
	- our concept of “dirt” in the West is one of “matter out of place”
		- We may think that our conceptions of what is “dirty” are “purely” scientific, but in actually they are just as SYMBOLIC as other cultural constructs which understand “dirt” in terms of ritual pollution
		- Our concept of “dirt” may not be couched in a religious idiom but that’s really the only difference
- **Conclusion: our concept of “dirt” may not be couched in a religious idiom but that’s really the only difference**

# Do Symbols Need to "Make Sense"
- Symbols don’t need to “make sense” to be meaningful, at the same time, they aren’t “nonsense,” but can be understood as part of complex systems of signification. They may have practical “uses” or “functions,” but their multiple meanings should not be reduced to these.

# Franz Boas and “Secondary Rationalizations”
- Franz Boas is credited with invented our modern anthropological concept of “culture”
- He maintained that (contrary to Tylor, e.g.) that culture is largely **learned** and **unconscious**
- Enculturation occurs through habituation and thus acts through **unconscious processes rather than rational deliberation**
- Though culture is largely transmitted unconsciously, **secondary rationalizations** are often offered to explain cultural values.
	- Cultural materialism (which includes medical materialism) provides the basis for many ‘secondary rationalizations’…
- **Key point of slide: cultural materialism (which includes medical materialism) provides the basis for many ‘secondary rationalizations**
	- This is problematic from a postmodern perspective; have to be careful about our impulse to rationalize complex cultural phenomena scientifically
	- Idea of coming up with secondary reasoning to describe something in a often reductionist way (such as saying people put christmas trees in their house because they filter the air)

# Symbology and “Pollution” as a Relative Concept
- The concept of **“respect pollution”** helps us understand how Hindu notions of purity/pollution are part of a complex symbolic ordering.

> Douglas cites EB Harper: ...Cow dung, like the dung of any other animal, is intrinsically impure and can cause defilement – in fact it will defile a god; but it is pure relative to a mortal...

## "Respect Pollution"
- Basically the idea of **purposely polluting/defiling yourself** to show respect or **devotion to a structurally superior individual** such as shaking their hand or Indian ritual of drinking liquid used to bathe ones feet; polluting something from a ritual standpoint
- Douglas gives the example of “respect pollution” in Hindu ritual to illustrate her argument that such rituals are predicated not on a “lack of hygiene” but a complex symbolic ordering
	- So called “respect pollution” **involves intentionally defiling oneself to show devotion to a structurally superior individual** (elders, gurus, gods, etc.)
	- Such examples of “respect pollution” contradict the assertion of Robertson Smith that “primitives” had no concept of hygiene; in fact, for the Hindus being observed by Harper, the concepts of purity and pollution were extremely well-elaborated; only because of this fact did the ritual (in essence, a **violation of a taboo**) obtain its power.
- In her chapter **“Secular Defilement”**, Mary Douglas argues that we must not conflate (material) “cleanliness” with (symbolic or ritual) “purity”

## Hindu notions of “pure” and “impure
- According to Louis Dumont, “caste” Hindus are regularly “polluted” (ritually or symbolically, not necessarily literally) by life events
	- What Dumont calls **“THE ORGANIC ASPECTS OF HUMAN LIFE”** — birth, death, menstruation, etc.
		- For such polluting events, BATHING, and WATER in particular, are cleansing and ritually purifying
		- Even more cleansing than WATER, are the five sacred products of the COW
	- Lower-caste Hindus, such as the Shudras and the Dalits, are understood to be in a constant state of “pollution” or ritual impurity, a state that cannot be “washed off”

# Dirt as "Matter out of Place"
- Mary Douglas, in her famous work Purity and Danger, discusses the notion of dirt as “matter out of place”
She points out that we in the West often think that our behaviors—especially with respect to dirt—are based entirely in empirical science, and especially, notions of “hygiene”
Often, our notions of what is “dirty” have little to do with material “dirt” but instead with stuff that is in a place that it doesn’t belong; that which doesn’t obey ordinary limits and boundaries—in other words, that which violates **taboos**...
- Dirt is a “residual category” (Douglas, 37)
It is that which “confuses” or “contradicts” our “cherished classifications and categories” (37); it’s the leftover matter that doesn’t fit; it if that which refuses “order” (36) **much like pigs who are impure due having cloven feet and not chewing cud**
- Idea of **western hypocrisy** as we critique other cultural practices for being unscientific yet in western societies we have just as much purely symbolic cultural practices that are not grounded in science or at least not primarily.

# In Conclusion
- It is not, as early anthropologists had (wrongly) assumed, that Hindus have no concept of “hygiene”
- In fact, it is precisely because Hindus have such a well-articulated and highly developed ideology of purity and “cleanliness” that otherwise defiling actions have such symbolic and ritual power
- As Mary Douglas argues, the distinction between “religious” and “secular” kinds of “dirt” is not clear-cut.
The only real difference between the symbolic “dirt” of “primitives” and “moderns,” she says, is that Westerners do not explain their own kinds of “symbolic” dirt using a religious idiom.
- **Taboos** — regarding purity and impurity — are usually symbolic
	- They are not dependent on physical circumstances; they are integrating, social mechanisms—not simple responses to economic or ecological pressures
	- This is not to say that taboos don’t interpret the material or the biological in a symbolic way—but they cannot always be reduced to a material (or biological/pathogenic) basis
