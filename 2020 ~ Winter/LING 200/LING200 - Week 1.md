# LING200 - Week 1

# Textbook Notes: Chapter 1

## Explicit Vs. Tacit
> Explicit Knowledge ~ (Also called conscious knowledge) Knowledge learned through study; knowledge of a language a linguist would have

> Tacit Knowledge ~ (Also called unconscious knowledge) Knowledge gained through the fluency of a language; knowledge of a language a native speaker would have

## Prescriptive Vs. Descriptive
> Prescriptive Grammar ~ Prescriptive grammar describes when people focus on talking about how a language should or ought to be used.

> Descriptive Grammar ~ Descriptive grammar, on the other hand, focuses on describing the language as it is used, not saying how it should be used. 

- Ex: Prescriptive grammar would say that the phrase "I didn't do nothing" is incorrect however that is irrelevant to the study of linguistics which concerns itself with descriptive grammar which is how language is actually used, the correctness of it is not what concerns the linguist

# Lecture Notes: Lecture 1

# Varieties of English
- Native speakers, while speaking their language perfectly, does not mean their **tacit** knowledge is adequate enough to understand the inner workings of their own language
- Things that seem natural and intuitive to native speakers must be taught and formulated according to the structure of the language that is not necessarily known despite speaking a certain language fluently
- There is no "standardized" English way of speaking, for example:
	- Canadian English
	- American English
	- British English
	- (Neither one is the "right way of speaking")
- Different varieties of English have different pronunciation schemes that distance themselves from each other however neither way of speech is the "right" or "wrong" way to speak
	- Ex: "Canadian raising" that causes things like "house" and "about" to be pronounced differently from American speech for example

# International Phonetic Alphabet
> IPA ~ International Phonetic Alphabet (lets you write in accents)

- Writing using IPA allows us to differentiate phonetic sounds that may differ within other accents (American vs. British) that cause words that sound the same to be pronounced differently
	- Ex: "Atom" being pronounced "adom"; different phonetic sounds are being utilized within a word that is spelt the same universally in English
	- Written English does not adequately exemplify the varieties in which it can be vocally spoken

- **Allophone vs. Phoneme**
- **Socio political vs. Scientific** / **Prescriptive vs. Descriptive**

- Idea of a natural language of speech that linguistics concerns itself with rather than the imposed language/pattern of speech of the ruling class
	- "Who are you talking to?" is an example of natural human language and "To whom are you talking?" is an imposed grammar structure from Latin and however correct it is is irrelevant as it is natural human speak to use the former of "Who" rather than "Whom"
