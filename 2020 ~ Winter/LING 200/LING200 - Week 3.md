# Going Forward: Summary of Chapters 1 & 2

## Linguistics & Cognitive Science
1. Linguistics a branch of Cognitive Science.
	- the study of a particular aspect of human knowledge – knowledge of language (KOL)
	- knowlege of language is unconscious or tacit knowledge. This is the type of knowledge that a native speaker has of his/her language. It is the knowledgethat develops naturally in human children (barring specific neurological disorders).
	- knowledge about language, for example, properties of language that we have discovered, is conscious or explicit knowledge. Relating a fact about French – that it has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine – is relating a bit of conscious knowledge. (Knowing this fact does not make you a speaker of French.)
	- what is knowledge, in general? Perhaps a combination of genetics, experience, and learned behavior...
	- what is a language? In a linguistic framework, there is no such thing as a language. Terms such as English are only definable socio-politically or geographically.
	- for the purposes of linguistics, KOL is about individual brains. If they’re human brains, they share many properties in common. We expect to find certain properties because the brains we’re interested in are human brains (for example, the apparent fact that the linguistic system does not base any operation on counting). In addition, we expect to find other properties because the brains had certain (different) experiences in the world (for example, some of the brains got French-type data, some got Telugu-type data, and some got English-type data).
	- the goal of linguistics is to make a model of KOL. The main part of the model is often called a computational system or a descriptive grammar. This contrasts with the traditional prescriptive grammar which contains rules about what some people think speakers should do.
2. What we would like to know about KOL:
	- how it works
	- how children can acquire it
3. General properties of KOL:
	- it is unconscious
	- it is rule-governed
	- it is abstract
4. What Linguistics is not about:
- how you’re supposed to talk (what is ‘correct’ and what is ‘incorrect’). That is the domain of prescriptive grammar (see earlier note).
- knowing lots of languages. It’s a great thing, but it’s not linguistics...
- writing. Some languages have it and some don’t. It’s irrelevant to KOL.

## Physical States vs. Mental States
- KOL is a ‘mental’ state – mental states are not directly observable.
- data that we use to determine the properties of KOL is taken, in part, from ‘physical’ sources (what people say).
- ‘what people say’ is their performance. (It is not a perfect reflection of their mental state.)
- ‘what people know’ (their mental state) is their competence
- linguists are interested in describing competence not performance, but the former is not directly observable, so we use the latter, knowing that it is flawed.

## Phonetics
1. Phonetics is the closest thing to physical reality we have for KOL. The field of phonetics hasthree different branches:
	- Acoustic Phonetics: the (measurable) physical properties of sounds of natural language.
	- Auditory Phonetics: the way the human auditory system processes sounds of natural language.
	- Articulatory Phonetics: the way that humans produce the sounds of natural language.
2. The articulation of spoken language requires:
	- an energy source. For every language, this is air that has been drawn in to the body. This air can be moved in certain ways to produce fluctuations in air pressure. English uses exclusively a pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism. All other languages have some sounds made with this airstream mechanism. Some languages use additional airstream mechanisms, such as ingressive or egressive glotallic (implosives, Sindhi, and ejectives, Lakhota), or an ingressive velaric airstream mechanism (clicks – Hottentot, Zulu, et al.)
	- ways to modify the airflow – all moving parts from the larynx upwards through the oraland pharyngeal cavities.
		- the larynx – location of the vocal folds. The vocal folds can be shut tightly (no air goes through), held closely together (they vibrate and produce sound, voicing), or held apart (and air passes through freely). The opening between the vocal folds is called the glottis.
		- the velum – soft tissue that hangs down in the back of the throat and allows air to pass through to the nasal cavity (normal breathing position). Can be used to close off nasal cavity (most speech sounds produced with the velum raised in this position).
		- the lower jaw – goes up and down...
		- the tongue – can block airflow through the oral cavity completely, can force air to go through a narrow opening (causing turbulence and high frequency noise), can allow air to pass on either side of it.
		- the lips– can do all the things the vocal folds can do, and can also be pursed/rounded.
3. Describing the articulation of natural language also requires a way of representing natural language sounds – the International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA.
	- Each IPA symbol represents a distinct sound of natural language. (In order to represent all of them (more than 250), it is necessary to use diacritics, as well.)
	- The sounds are divided broadly into two categories, consonants and vowels.
	- Some sounds which are normally considered consonants can act like vowels under certain circumstances. In this case, we call the consonants syllabic or vocalic and mark them with a subscripted short vertical line (or sometimes a dot).
	- Sounds of natural language are made up of smaller components. A traditional way of describing these is to use three descriptive features for consonants: voicing, place, and manner; and four for vowels: height, front/back, round/unround, tense/lax. In addition, all natural language sounds are either made orally (that is, with the velum raised to block the passage of air through the nasal cavity), or nasally (with the velum lowered to allow air to flow through the nasal cavity). Since the default for speech sounds seems to be that they are oral, we only make particular mention if a sound is nasal.
	- The [a] symbol is also used for a back low, unrounded, lax vowel.
	- Following is a chart of English vowels. In addition to the dimensions of height and front/back, the vowels are classified according to:
		- Round/Unround – All and only the back vowels are round.
		- Tense/Lax – All central and low vowels are lax ([@], [a], [æ]). In addition, the ‘funny’ symbol mid and high vowels are lax ([I],[E], [U], [O]).
		- The carat symbol (an upside-down ‘v’) is sometimes used for schwas that are in stressed syllables.
		- Primary stress is typically indicated by a short vertical line or an acute accent mark.

# IPA
> IPA ~ International Phonetic Alphebet

- Works to have a one to one equivilancy between sounds and symbol

# Sound Production
- **Pulmonic egressive mechanism** = voice producing throat
- Sounds are created by manipulation airflow in various ways and at various locations in the throat, nasal cavity, mouth, lips, etc.

## Place of Articulation
- Labial
- Dental
- Alvealar
- Palatal
- Velar
- Uvular
- Glottal

## Manner of Articulation
> Place of articulation + manner; Ex: labial stop, alvealar stop, etc.

- Manners can be voiced (vocal chords engaged) or voiceless (vocal chrods relaxed/only airflow); Ex: [s] vs. [z]

### Consonants

- **Stops** (closure in the vocal track):
	- Labial stop -> [p]
		- Voiced labial stop -> [b]
	- Alvealar stop -> [t]
		- Voiced alvealar stop -> [d]
	- Velar stop -> [k]
		- Voiced velar stop -> [g]
	- Glottal stop -> [ʔ]
- **Fricative** (creating turbulance/noise with a partial closure in the vocal tract):
	- Labial fricative -> [f]
		- Voiced labial fricative -> [v]
	- Dental fricative -> [θ]
		- Voiced dental fricative -> [ð]
	- Alvealar fricative -> [s]
		- Voiced alvealar fricative -> [z]
