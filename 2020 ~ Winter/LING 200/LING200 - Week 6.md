# LING200 - Week 6

- Midterm today

# Homework 1 Review Before the Midterm
- **Performance vs. competence** can be understood with a **hardware vs. software** metaphor
	- Linguistics concerns itself only with the **competence/software** side
	- Ex: Slurring "i don't know" into "iohno"; intent is the same however performance to articulate sounds is what is being impaired yet slurred or un-slurred the meaning/intent of the sounds produced is the same; competence/intent is always constant and the only relevant factor
- **writing systems are irrelevant to linguistics aside from IPA, therefor so are spelling mistakes**
- Manner of articulation + place of articulation + voicing = features/characteristics of any given consonant
	- You might be asked on a test to identify the pair of sounds out of a list of pairs that only have 1,2, etc. **difference in feature**
	- **Dialects are not a concept in linguistics**; dialects are a socio-political designation and not the authority of linguistics
