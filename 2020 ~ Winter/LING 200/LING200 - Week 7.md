# LING200 - Week 7

# Rule Ordering
- Last topic of phonology

> Rule Ordering ~ Applying multiple linguistic rules in a specific order

- **The order in which linguistic rules are applied matter** as conditional rules may affect words in different ways depending on which rule is applied first

# Morphology

- Free morphemes vs. bound morphemes
	- Free morphemes stand on their own, such as the word **cat**. Cat is **not devidable further** into smaller morphemes, it cannot be taken appart into smaller parts with their own meanings
	- Bound morphemes are marked with a "-" such as **"-s"**. "-s" and cannot stand on its own as it ownly gains meaning when it is applied to something else; in this case applied to the end of a noun to add plurality such as combining with "cat" to make "cats", a new word with a slightly different meaning. Bound morphemes can be prefixes and suffixes as well as **infixes (segment placed inside of words, not at the start or end)**

> Prefix ~ Something you put at the start of words

- Examples of prefixes include: /-ri/

> Suffix ~ Something you put at the end of words

- Examples of suffixes include: /-s/

> Infix ~ Something you put inside of words

- Notated with 2 dashes around the segments 
- Examples of infixes include: /-l-/
- Infixes must interupt something **NOT** occur between segments, just because you have 2 prefixes doesnt mean the second one is an infix
	- Ex 1: "reupload" -> /re/-/up/-/load/; **/up/ is NOT an infix**, it is the second prefix and not interupting the word
	- Ex 2: "antideestablishmentarianism" -> /anti/-/de/-/establish/-/ment/-/arian/-/ism/; Each are just stacked prefixes
- Examples of things that **ARE** infixes include:
	- **-bloody-, -fucking-, -fricken-**
	- These can be inserted into the middle of words to **interupt** words that otherwise cannot be broken down further
	- "Marga-fucking-rita" -> "margarita" + "fucking" inserted to interupt
	- **HOWEVER**, a word such as "un-fucking-believable" is **NOT** an example of an infix occuring because it is interupting a prefix and a root that are already seperate components
		- To turn this example into a infixated word place the /-fucking-/ here -> "unbe-fucking-lievable"; in this example /-fucking-/ is once again acting as an infix because it is **interupting** "believable" when it suually cannot be broken down further
