# Varieties of English
- Native speakers, while speaking their language perfectly, does not mean their **tacit** knowledge is adequate enough to understand the innerworkings of their own language
- Things that seem natural and intuitive to native speakers must be tought and formulized according to the structure of the language that is not neccesarilly known despite speaking a certain language fluently
- There is no "standardized" english way of speaking, for example:
	- Canadian english
	- Americain english
	- British english
	- (Neither one is the "right way of speaking")
- Different varieties of english have different pronounciation schemes that distance themselves from each other however neither way of speach is the "right" or "wrong" way to speak
	- Ex: "Canadian raising" that causes things like "house" and "about" to be pronounced differently from Americain speach for example

# International Phonetic Alphabet
> IPA ~ International Phonetic Alphabet (lets you write in accents)

- Writing using IPA allows us to differentiate phonetic sounds that may differ within other accents (american vs. british) that cause words that sound the same to be pronounced differently
	- Ex: "Atom" being pronounced "adom"; different phonetic sounds are being utilized within a word that is spelt the same universally in english
	- Written english does not adequately exemplify the varieties in which it can be vocally spoken

- **Allophore vs. Phoneme**
- **Sociopolitical vs. Scientific** / **Prescriptive vs. Descriptive**

- Idea of a natural language of speach that linguistics concerns itself with rather than the imposed language/pattern of speach of the ruling class
	- "Who are you talking to?" is an example of natural human language and "To whome are you talking?" is an imposed grammar structure from latin and however correct it is is irrelavent as it is natural human speak to use the former of "Who" rather than "Whom"
