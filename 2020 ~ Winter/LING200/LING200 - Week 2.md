# LING200 - Week 2

- Study of language cannot be generalized; must think of the language of the self as language is varried between each individual
- Language is a computation system
	- Ex: Thnk of language as a program within the computer of the human mind

# Language as a System
- **Root Words** & **Affix's** as a subset of **morphology**
	- Root: Cat, Dog, Bat, Car, etc.
	- Affix: "-s" (English item that pluralizes nouns), "'s" (English item that connotes possession also called **genetive**)
		- Ex: Cat -> **cats**, dog -> **dogs**
- Components of words can be combined to create new means through the manipulation of root words through adding affixes & prefixes for example
- Morphology studies the "system" of language such as the items added to modify words
	- Studies language as a "rule based" system
- Guy named Panini wrote a comprehensive manual to Sanskrit grammar and a guy named William Jones noticed there were unmistakable similarities between Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek
- **Chompsky** says all languages use the same system called **universal grammar**
	- It is universal grammar that linguistics tries to describe
	- Idea of universal grammar is an attempt at generalization to explain language with a universal theory

# Language in Children
- Children learn language effortlessly while adults find language acquisition very difficult
	- Things that seem complicated to non-native speakers are just natural to children (things such as gendered nouns in French or compound nouns in German)
- Children learn language through context and absortion by being around speach from a very young age

# Textbook Notes: Chapter 2

## Behaviorism
> Behaviorism ~ Theory that human and animal behavior can be explained in terms of conditioning, without appeal to thoughts or feelings, and that psychological disorders are best treated by altering behavior patterns.

- **Nature Vs. Nuture**
- Behaviorism argues that free-will does not exist and every action is simply conditioned over time; if we are the product of our environment everything is influenced and therefor thoughts and actions are not produced independent of ones conditioning
- The claim of behaviorism is that nature is irrelevant as experience/environment (nurture) is the deciding factor of ones life
	- John B. Watson: "Give me 20 blank children and i will create 20 violinists"

	# Textbook Notes: Chapter 2

## 3 Branches of Phonetics
1. Acoustic phonetics
2. Articulatory phonetics
	- **This is the focus of this chapter**
3. Auditory (or perceptual) phonetics

## Articulatory Phonetics
- Air is needed in order to produce sound
- Most common technique for moving air to create speach used in all human languages involves exhalation (breathing out) and is known as the **pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism**

### Consonants
- Sounds produced with a complete closure at some point in the vocal tract are called **stops**
	- Ex: [p] & [t] sounds in [apapapap] & [atatatat]

> Manners of Articulation ~ The various ways of constricting airflow

> Voicing ~ The technical name for the sound (or lack of) produced by the rapid flapping of the vocal cords; ex: something can be voiceless like [s] or voiced like [z]

#### Places of Articulation
1. Labial: Point of constriction is at the **lips**
	- Ex: [p] sounds
2. Labiodental:
3. Dental: Point of constriction is against the **back of the teeth**
4. Interdental
5. Alveolars: Point of constriction is at the **alveolar ridge** (start of hard palate)
	- Ex: [t] sounds
6. Alveopalatal:
7. Palatals: Segments produced **behind the alveolar ridge**
8. Velars: Segments produced on the **velum** (soft palate)
9. Uvulars: Sounds produced at the **uvula** area of the mouth/throat
10. Glottal: Sounds produced through the contriction/closing of the **glotis** (adam's apple)

#### Manners of Articulation
1. Stops
2. Nasal: Consonants produced with te **velum** open
3. Fricative: Sounds characterized by a great deal of noise and created by air moving quickly through a small passage
	- Ex: [s]
4. Affricative:
5. Lateral:
6. Glide:
