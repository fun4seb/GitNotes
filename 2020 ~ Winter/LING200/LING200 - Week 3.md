# LING200 - Week 3

# IPA
> IPA ~ International Phonetic Alphebet

- Works to have a one to one equivilancy between sounds and symbol

# Sound Production
- **Pulmonic egressive mechanism** = voice producing throat
- Sounds are created by manipulation airflow in various ways and at various locations in the throat, nasal cavity, mouth, lips, etc.

## Place of Articulation
- Labial
- Dental
- Alvealar
- Palatal
- Velar
- Uvular
- Glottal

## Manner of Articulation
> Place of articulation + manner; Ex: labial stop, alvealar stop, etc.

- Manners can be voiced (vocal chords engaged) or voiceless (vocal chrods relaxed/only airflow); Ex: [s] vs. [z]
