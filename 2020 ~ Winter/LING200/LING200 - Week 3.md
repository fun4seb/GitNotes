# LING200 - Week 3

# IPA
> IPA ~ International Phonetic Alphebet

- Works to have a one to one equivilancy between sounds and symbol

# Sound Production
- **Pulmonic egressive mechanism** = voice producing throat
- Sounds are created by manipulation airflow in various ways and at various locations in the throat, nasal cavity, mouth, lips, etc.

## Place of Articulation
- Labial
- Dental
- Alvealar
- Palatal
- Velar
- Uvular
- Glottal

## Manner of Articulation
> Place of articulation + manner; Ex: labial stop, alvealar stop, etc.

- Manners can be voiced (vocal chords engaged) or voiceless (vocal chrods relaxed/only airflow); Ex: [s] vs. [z]

### Consonants

- **Stops** (closure in the vocal track):
	- Labial stop -> [p]
		- Voiced labial stop -> [b]
	- Alvealar stop -> [t]
		- Voiced alvealar stop -> [d]
	- Velar stop -> [k]
		- Voiced velar stop -> [g]
	- Glottal stop -> [ʔ]
- **Fricative** (creating turbulance/noise with a partial closure in the vocal tract):
	- Labial fricative -> [f]
		- Voiced labial fricative -> [v]
	- Dental fricative -> [θ]
		- Voiced dental fricative -> [ð]
	- Alvealar fricative -> [s]
		- Voiced alvealar fricative -> [z]
	- Alveo-palatal fricative [ʃ]
	- Glottal fricative -> [h]
- **Nasal**:
	- Labial nasal -> [m]
	- Alvealar nasal -> [n]
	- Velar nasal -> [ŋ]
- **Affricate**:
	- Alveo-palatal -> [tʃ]
		- Voiced alveo-palatal -> [dʒ]
- **Liquid**:
	- Lateral alvealar liquid -> [I]
		- Retroflex alvealar liquid -> [r]
