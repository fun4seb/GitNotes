# LING200 - Week 4

- **Phonology will be IMPORTANT for later chapters and exam!**
- The idea that there is a absence of sound between words is an illusions, the reality is sentences are a string of uninterrupted sounds that don't have gaps in sound that directly correlate with spaces between words

# Phonology
- Certain properties emerges due to performance mistakes founded in human limitation and error
	- One can say a word over and over however it is never identical to the word before
	- Ex: Variability of vowel pronunciation between many speakers and where they fall on the chart
- Capturing the distinctions between vowels is futile and useless because it means you need to find a special symbol for every instance of pronunciation; not constant, acceptable gray area
- Just like voicing, nasality can be detected on a **spectrogram**
- "~" can be put above vowels to modify it in a way to add nasality
- In English, there is a rule where the tilde will be applied to [É›] to add nasality to sounds that occur before a nasal such as [n]; there are many of these patterns that identify consistencies between two sounds across languages

> Phoneme ~ Any of the abstract units of the phonetic system of a language that correspond to a set of similar speech sounds (such as the velar \k\ of cool and the palatal \k\ of keel) which are perceived to be a single distinctive sound in the language.

> Minimal Pairs ~ Pairs of words or phrases in a particular language, spoken or signed, that differ in only one phonological element, such as a phoneme, toneme or chroneme, and have distinct meanings.

- Examples of minimal pairs include:
	- "Page" & "paid"
	- "Back" & "bag"
	- "Dark" & "dart"
- **NOTE: an absence of sound does not consitute a minimal pair; "bread" & "bed" are therefor not minimal pairs (lack of "r" sound doesnt make them minimal pairs)**

> Homophones ~ Pair of words that have 2 unique meanings despite sharing an identical pronunciation

- Examples of homophones include:
	- "Soul" & soul"
	- "Pour" & pore"
	- "Role" & roll'

- **We must be able to deduce the rules of any unkown languages**
