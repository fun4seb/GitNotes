# LING200 - Week 4

- **Phonology will be IMPORTANT for later chapters and exam!**
- The idea that there is a absence of sound between words is an illusions, the reality is sentences are a string of uninterupted sounds that dont have gaps in sound that directly correlate with spaces between words

# Phonology
- Certain properties emerges due to performance mistakes founded in human limitation and error
	- One can say a word over and over however it is never identicle to the word before
	- Ex: Variability of vowel pronounciation between many speakers and where they fall on the chart
- Capturing the distinctions between vowels is futile and useless because it means you need to find a special symbol for every instance of pronounciation; not constant, acceptable grey area
- Just like voicing, nasality can be detected on a **spectogram**
- "~" can be put above vowels to modify it in a way to add nasality
- In english, there is a rule where the tilde will be applied to [É›] to add nasality to sounds that occur before a nasal such as [n]; there are many of these patterns that identify consistencies between two sounds across languages

> Phoneme ~ Any of the abstract units of the phonetic system of a language that correspond to a set of similar speech sounds (such as the velar \k\ of cool and the palatal \k\ of keel) which are perceived to be a single distinctive sound in the language.

> Minimal Pairs ~ Pairs of words or phrases in a particular language, spoken or signed, that differ in only one phonological element, such as a phoneme, toneme or chroneme, and have distinct meanings.

- **We must be able to deduce the rules of any unkown languages**
