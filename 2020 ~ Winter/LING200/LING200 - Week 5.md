# LING200 - Week 5

# Rule Statements
> Rule Statement ~ SOUND A > SOUND B / CONEXT

- This rule statement says that [SOUND A] will change to [SOUND B] when it occures in a specific context
	- Contexts could be occurance before or after a specific sound or characteristic of sound (nasal, aspiration, vowel, etc.)
	- Ex: ɛ > ɛ̃ / _ n --> "ɛ always changes to ɛ̃ when it occurs before a nasal in English"

> UR/Underlying Representation, "thing in the mind of a speak of...", form of a word in the mind of a speaker before phonological rules are applied to it

> Surface Forms/Representation ~ The phonetic representation of the word or sound, "the thing that is spoken after it is formulated in the mind of the speaker", what is spoken as a surface form often differs from what is in the mind of the speaker (Ex: Speakers of Korean's difficulty with the english [r] sound)

## Deducing Rules from Unknown languages
1. Given a segment (sound) that occurs within a list of foreign words, record all unique segments that occur both before and after **(dont repeat)**, remember to also **record word boundaries aswell** with a **"#"**
	- Ex: b: # _ u, m _ r, # _ r, etc
	- Overlaps between common segments occuring before and after mean no complimentary distribution
2. Based on the sounds observed to occur in their specific contexts, **find a patern** that establish a consistent interaction that could subsitute a rule
3. State rule using formula and prose

## Contrastive distribution in Phonology
