# SOCI244 - Week 9: Leisure & Harm
- **HARM TO OTHERS is the crucial dimension in regulating harm in leisure**, she emphasized this as the key point of the entire lecture and topic of leisure and harm

# Globalization has led to a global increase in alcohol consumption
- Until approx. 1990, most alchol was consumed in the west, **in developed countries**
- Economic development in China and India - major increase in alcohol consumption there
	- work cultures more openly encourage drinking cultures
- 10% increase in global alcohol consumption 1990-2017
- 15% increase forcased from 2017-2027
- **Alcohol as an emerging pastime in the developing world**

# Dangers of Alcohol
- Alcohol causes approx. 5% of deaths worldwide (WHO) yet alcohol is relatively lightly regulated and a crucial part of leisure practice worldwide
- Corporate conglomerates market alcohol to increasingly niche demographics
- 26% of alcohol consumed globally is homemade (WHO)
	- Huge market alcohol corporations are missing out on
	- **Also represent an entire leisure practice in itself** centered around homemade brewing of alcohol
- Drinking is **heavily socially enforced**; almost required in social settings such as clubs, FROSH, etc.

# The Age of "Responsible Consumerism"
- "buying things that don't do harm"; environmentally conscious consumption
- We expect corporations to address social problems
- **"Ethical consumption"**
- Some corporations offer **solutions so social problems that might otherwise be the state's responsibility**
	- tech companies creating apps that solve social issue where the act of solving social issues has always been the responsibility of the state (health, transportation, security, etc.)

## How do Alcohol & Tobacco companies address concerns about their products' effects?
- **"Responsible consumption"** campaigns
- These campaigns are still advertising the be an active consumer of the product
- There are positive correlations between exposure to ads and higher alcohol/tobacco use
- People not exposed to such advertisement campaigns by alcohol & tobacco companies are seen to consumer much less alcohol; advertising is exploitative and works

# "Corporate Responsibility" is Tricky for Addictive Substances
- Unlike other consumer goods, the quantity of alcohol consumed increases risk on oneself and community. Being a shopaholic never hurt anyone meaningfully.
- No alcohol brand can claim that its product is less harmful (aka, less intoxicating)
- Unlike other corps, which can mitigate environmental impact, etc.
- **Harm is built into the product**, people like it and it is important within our social world generally
	- Being able to drink a lot is a sought after and there is a **level of status associated with enduring harm to alcohol and other substances**

# When Alcohol was Prohibited, Crime Surged
- **Temperance Movement**, largely led by women and argued that alcohol was a huge social problem, leading to domestic abuse, men were spending too much other their income on alcohol. Huge influence on the governments decision to ban alcohol thus marking the prohibition era
- State intervention can only accomplish so much
- Smuggling, gang violence and dangerous unregulated products made prohibition a catastrophe; **period of massive wealth for criminals**
- Legalization of drugs - harm reduction as part of regulating leisure and addiction

# Alcohol & Tobacco are both Life-Threatening
- Despite this, norms around alcohol are **LOOSENING** while norms around tobacco are **TIGHTENING**
- State control of tobacco use has transformed the leisure practice - pushed it from the mainstream to the margin
- Meanwhile alcohol is increasingly popular/fashionable/**status-oriented**
- **Social stigmas surrounding tobacco has changed DURASTICALLY over the years**, before people would smoke inside and now people are pushed to their limits and forced outside as people rarely even smoke in their own homes nowadays
- **Double standard**; alcohol consumed by the middle or upper class are associated with knowledge, class, culture, etc while alcohol consumed by the lower class is associated with social liability, abuse, etc.

# State Control of Tobacco Use
- No smoking in public areas, near building entrances, inside apartment buildings
- To violate those rules you risk SERIOUS social sanction
- Smoking goes from social norm to social BREACH in 25 years

## The Smoker does Damage to Others as well as Themselves
- **HARM TO OTHERS is the crucial dimension in regulating harm in leisure**, things are only social problems when they do harm to others - **KEY IDEA OF LECTURE**
	- Leisure practices are only regulated when they cross the boundary between harm to oneself and harm to the surrounding society, partially explains why tobacco was so heavily enforced compared to drinking where the harm is upfront and on the surface only harmful tot he self
- Control of alcohol consumption is most effective via DRUNK DRIVING LAWS
- Drunk driving laws not heavily enforced until late 1970's
- Influence of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving)
- 200% increase in drunk driving arrests between 1976-1986

# Reading Notes: The Trauma Floor
- Idea of service workers behind leisure practices such as social media browsing; price they pay to provide the consumer leisure
- Very dramatically written
- Inhumane working conditions; forced exposure to mentally damaging content
- "Trauma Bonding", building emotional connections through shared trauma as seen amongst Facebook community moderators
- Agreement of fringe views through prolonged exposure; dangerous
