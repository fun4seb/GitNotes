# SOCI244 - Midterm Notes

# The Entrepreneurial Self
- Idea of the **Entrepreneural Self**, that has emerged in the modern age; marketting yourself as a product that exists within a market, **"hustle culture"**

# Three Important Concepts
1. Essentialism
2. Psychologism
3. Contraints & Affordances

## 1. Essentialism
> Essentialism ~ Ideology that certain Humans have "essential" or "innate" qualities that create our specieis diversity. Essentially certain people are born with innate qualities that differ from other people

- **Examples of essentialist thought:**
	- "Men and women are "naturally" different"
	- "Women are naturally more nurturing than men"
	- "Black people are better at sports". 

## 2. Psychologism
> Psychologism ~ There's a "psychological" explanation for certain leisure practices. The idea that people seek out certain stimuli because of psychological need

- Psychologism can be viewed as essentialist thought, reducing explanations down to a singular reasoning for peoples leisure practice, innate to their psycological state.

## 3. Constraints & Affordances
> Constraints ~ Environmental or social factors that shape/influence/limit our choices and behaviours; something that constrains behviours/actions/activities

- **Examples of Constraints:** No time; no money; social isolation; "hostile architecture" (urban design specifically installed to limit actions like public urination or public sleeping)

> Affordances ~ Things that are made possible/brought into being that provide new opportunities; something that promotes/provides opportunities/convenience

- **Examples of Affordances:** Affordable public transit; 30-hour workweek; affordable childcare

- Arguments about "freedom of choice" = do not acknowledge the presence of constraints/affordances

## Common Pitfalls in Analyzing Leisure Practices
- Ideas about "well being" and "satisfaction" = **essentialist/rely too much on psychologism**
- Arguments about "freedom of choice" = **do not acknowledge the presence of constraints/affordances**

# The Theory of a “Leisure Society”
> Leisure Society ~ An idealist society in which leisure is the primary pastime, work is irrelavant and everyone exists in a utopia of unending leisure

- Context: Increased industrialization and automation in 20th century
- Social theorists predicted that a **"Leisure Society"** would emerge in the late 20th century
- Thought that the emergaence of automation would mean people would no longer have to work
- Leisure would become the primary pastime; **a utopian society of only leisure**

## Problems with the "Leisure Society" Theory
- The theory was soon debunked
	- It didn't ask any critical questions about leisure itself, **leisure FOR WHOME, HOW, WHY, AT WHAT COST?**
- It did not take into conideration the **GLOBAL COST** of leisure - the outsourcing of manufacturing/production that makes leisure among Westerners possible
- It was **fundamentally apolitical** - did not account for power/positionality/generationally permiating constraints
- The "Leisure Society" theory was **highly essentialist/psychologist**
	- Made major assumptions about what humans would do given unlimited leisure time
	- Did not account for bahaviours considered "depraved" such as:
		- Socially disengaged behaviour
		- Self-harming behaviour such as drug abuse and dangerous activities
		- "Anti-social" behaviour

# Social Capital
> Social Capital ~ Social capital is a positive product of human interaction. The positive outcome may be tangible or intangible and may include useful information, innovative ideas, and future opportunities.

- **Voluntary participation in community or civic well-being** grows ones social capital
	- Ex: Helping family, friends and neighbors; volunteering; coaching; taking part in creative activities
- Social capital is accumulated through the development of social networks
	- "Who you know"
- You can generate a "wealth" of social capital that benefit individuals in an increasingly social environment
- Acquiring social capital is instrumentalized in contemporary life; connection/networks are increasingly relevant to employment success
- Networking at social events is synonymous with acquiring social capital
- **Social capital = social influence**

## Social Capital Vs. Social "Reach"
- It's easy to confuse social capital with social media **influence**
	- **Influence ≠ social capital**
- **Social capital is not easily lost**; it's based on a network of real-world relationships, exchanged favors, trust, reputation, and invested **TIME**
- Social "reach" is subject to an audience's taste
- The ease of the "unfollow" versus the work of creating/maintaining real-world relationships

## Social Capital’s Relationship to “Active Citizenship”
> Active Citizen ~ A citizen who takes an active role in the community (as in crime prevention and neighborhood watch); takes an active interest into the wellbeing of their own communities

- Active citizenship = **"giving a shit"**
- Relied on free flows of information/media, informing citizens about health risks, environmental conditions, etc
	- **No information means no activism**
- Active citizens work to make the world healthier. safer for leisure, which has major implications for leisure practice itself

- **Examples of Active Citizenship:**
	- Research on smoking/bans on smoking
	- Research on impact of alcohol/drunk driving; social norms about alcohol consumption changing (MADD)
	- Littering/pollution regulations
	- Hunting for animals as bygone practice
	- Animal fighting as bygone practice
	- Carbon emissions concerns
	- Concerns about smartphone addiction

### Pre-Globalization: "Safety" Concerns Related to the SELF
- **Contemporary "safety" concerns tend to relate to OTHERS and the ENVIRONMENT as well**
- These concerns are the result of ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, which is bound up with our need to accumulate SOCIAL CAPITAL to survive

# Flow States
- Humans are understood to enter a "flow" state during sustained, focused activity that is challenging but manageable
	- Challenging/engaging activities provide a sense of fullfillment and satisfaction with the self
- "Flow" can be achieved across all kinds of leisure activities
- "Flow" is a useful concept to descrive the "enjoyable" aspects of leisure; why do we enjoy certain activities more than other? Why are we sometimes bored/anxious versus engaged/happy? Its because of flow
- **Many leisure practices can be understood as pursuits of "flow" within certain constraints**

- **Activities where a flow state can be achieved:**
	- Sports
	- Chess
	- Puzzles
	- Casual sex (that is not used for social ordering.mainting a hierarchy, as it is among most mammals)
	- Games
	- Art

## Flow as a Morally Empty Concept
- Flow is a state people can achieve when they are harming each other and themselves
	- Serial killers, drug addicts, people who neglect their families in favor of selfish pursuits
- "Flow" is a useful way to understand what makes some things fun and other things boring, but it's not a morally sound "goal" in and of itself

# Webs of Interdependence
- We all exist within networks/webs of interdependence
- No one makes leisure choices that are not influenced by others/have no influence on others
- Leisure never occurs in a vacuum. It often has unintended consequences

- **Examples of Webs of interdependence:**
	- Location
	- Class
	- Gender identity
	- Racial identity
	- Social capital
	- Historical context
	- Many others

# Leisure as “Declaration”
- It's how we **declare** our **allegiance**
- We seek to align ourselves with certain groups, tastes, classes, histories
- Leisure is where people make the most declarations and cement their identity and views

# Embodiment & Emplacement

# Hegemony
> Hegemony ~ Leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others

## Cultural Hegemony
- Cultural hegemony refers to **domination or rule maintained through ideological or cultural means**
- Usually achieved through social institutions, which allow those in power to strongly influence the values, norms, ideas, expectations, worldview, and behavior of the rest of society.
- Cultural hegemony functions by framing the worldview of the ruling class, and the social and economic structures that embody it, as just, legitimate, and designed for the benefit of all, even though these structures may only benefit the ruling class.
- Cultural hegemony, or our tacit agreement with the way that things are, **is a result of socialization, our experiences with social institutions, and our exposure to cultural narratives and imagery**, all of which reflect the beliefs and values of the **ruling class**.

## The Distinction Between Hegemony and Power
- **Hegemony is distinct from rule by force or power**, as in a military dictatorship or authoritative state, because it allows the ruling class to exercise authority using the "peaceful" means of ideology and culture.

## Resistance & Hegemony

# Taste Regimes

# Coding & Representation
- Leisure can act as a **system of representation**, what does this mean?

# Capitalism: Leisure and “Freedom” in the West
- Leisure is not morally neutral in capitalist societies
- it is EARNED through work/it is meaningless outside the context of work
- Capitalist choice ensures our "freedom" (relative to non-capitalist regimes)
- This freedom is enacted during our leisure time

## Capitalism gets its sheen from the leisure opportunities it promises, not from the opportunities to work
- Hard work = the earning power to CHOOSE one's leisure pursuits/be "free"
- To reject work/rely on social services is to be marginal
- This morality evoles into -> "leisure" of the wageless = crime

## There is a positive connection between leisure and freedom in the West
- Inhibits reform to any existing capitalist system
- The "freedom of choice" under capitalism becomes a social
- This makes attempts to envision leisure beyond capitalist boundaries seem suspect/illegitimate

## What forms of leisure exist beyond capitalist boundaries?
- Leisure combined with shared care-work (volunteerism)
- Communal living
- Shared commodities (cars/spoting goods)

# Food as Leisure

## Foodism and Globalization
> Globalization ~ the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale

- Globalization increases with time as advances in technology make connections with the world on a global scale more accessible such as the development of the internet or transportaion

## Pre-Globalization
- Pre-globalization, Westerners worked in manufacturing/agriculture. Now, most of us work in knowledge/service/health care industries
- Pre-globalization, leisure was more often an END IN ITSELF
- It was what we did when we were NOT WORKING: Relaxation; hobbies; socialization; transgression

## Post-Globalization
- Work is mostly limited to within the knowledge/healthcare/service sectors
- Exposed to unlimited mass communications
- Take travel and mobility for granted (pre-globalization, travel was a luxury - a leisure pastime for elites)
- Spend much more time in educational institutions
- Are competing for ever-fewer stable jobs

# Uneven Distribution of Leisure
- Global inequality & local income inequality limit access to meaningful leisure activities
- Leisure and professional success are TIGHTLY LINKED
	- Ex: Silicon Valley parents raising "tech free" kids
		- Why are they doing this? What makes this leisure choice possible?

## Foodism and Car Culture

# Prosumption

# Encoding & Decoding

# Tourism
- In a media-saturated society, tourism is a highly mediated pastime
- It is not simply a questions of traveling to new places
- It is a form of consumption of objects
- The consumption of objects occurs in how we **SEE** them, how we **CAPTURE** them, and how we **BROADCAST** them
- **Media has become an integral part of the tourism experience**
	- Ex: People lining up on the Everest summit to take pictures, pictures of the Joker staircase dancing scene location
	- Media influences tourism patterns

## Tourism is a leisure practice based on SIGHTS
- What is a **SIGHT** (Ex: Eiffel Tower)
- A symbolic marker that contains many meanings **CONDENSED** into one objects
- Tourists do not **SEE** Paris - they see **SIGHTS** that **REPRESENT** PARIS
- They seek visual information that **CONFIRMS** existing symbolic representations of Paris
- Tourism = seeking sights that **MATCH** the symbolic identity of a place
- Each place has a set of sights that tourists are expected to consume
	- This could include specific "beach" sights and all that encompasses that (umbrellas, white sand, ocean horizon, etc.)
- A tourists "authentic experience" of "doing a country" is an entirely uniquely tourist experience

# Satisfaction of tourism based on this idea of matching experience with expectations
- To orient oneself in opposition - "off the beaten path" - nonetheless is defined by prevailing approach
- Seeking a symbolic match for "authenticity" rather than "tourism" is the same leisure practice

# Themeing: Leisure Spaces as Containers for Consumption
> Theming ~ symbolic use of visual cues within a space to define it for the people who inhabit it; fulfills expectations for what any space is; theming defines the space

## Leisure spaces can be "themed" around certain preferred behaviors
- Commercial leisure spaces can be **CONTAINERS** for human interaction
	- Ex: Casinos, Disneyland, nightclubs, shopping malls, all-inclusive resorts, etc. are all **CONATINERS** for human interaction
- Objects are arrayed within the container to encourage humans to behave in desired ways
	- Ex: Free buffet in casinos = keep people gambling longer
- Convenience works both ways
- The way a tourist environment is themed cultivates an image of any one place a tourist might visit; theming characterizes the type of experiences any space provides (Ex: vacation to Disneyland is viewed different to a vacation to Mexico due to how each experience and setting is uniquely themed)

## The theming of activities in public space = increasingly controlled by commercial imperatives
- Cities cant afford to maintain large amounts if space for free leisure without corporate sponsorship/help
- Corporations by space/presence in urban leisure spaces (parks, sports stadiums, public squares)
- Virtually no space in urban public space is not oriented toward commercial interests

## Themed environments must appeal to the broadest population for profit maximization
- Public space has become a place of **consumer communion**
- If the imperative is to reach the highest number of consumers, the number signs/themes must be limited so as to be inclusive

## Theming doesn't ONLY serve capitalist interests - it can serve to SUBVERT too
- Gang, drug, and social resistance subcultures use **THEMEING** too
- Theming itself is not a capitalist practice
	- Money is not always required to theme a space
- Theming often draws from pre-capitalist images and stories - AKA **SHARED MYTHS**

# Mythogenesis
- Development and reproduction of narratives that dramatizes world visions/senses of community into compelling metaphors
- A selective and seductive account of human action upon nature and culture
- Landscape/battles/wars/victories/"God's plan"
- Myth transform these into markers of **CULTURAL/RACE IDENTITY**

# Myth vs. Ideology
- **Ideology is historically based**, **while myth is faith-based**
- Ideology functions to legitimate dominance of one group over another
- Myth functions to delineate inclusion into a group

## Examples of Myths & Ideologies
- **Myths:**
	- The Aryan race of the Nazis
	- "Manifest Destiny" in the United States
- **Ideologies:**
	- Working-class heritage is not as worthy of preservation as elite heritage
	- Wealth is the result of moral superiority
- **Myths exist as STORIES; ideologies exist as ARGUMENTS**

## Ideologies and myths are inscribed in the landscape
- There is no such thing as a "mythless space"
- Even wild nature - it's "preserved" to represent the mythological past before human development. The "wilderness" is myth
- It represents a "timeless" reality that precedes humans

## Myth is hard to analyze because it is so embedded in our perspective...
- But historical perspective helps
- Romantic period (early 1800's) art, poetry, literature, and music romanticized wild places 
	- During the romantic period nature was turned into a series of aesthetics that turns into themes and sights and this all started with the romantics
- Wild nature represented truth, emotional honesty - cutting through the "artifice" of city life. The aestheticization of nature

## Myths of the Late 1800's - Rational Recreation Movement
- Fresh air and exercise = morally correct
- "Healthy leisure" an antidote to moral corruption (drugs, sex, other immoral acts)
- Based on this belief, nature = fresh air = mind/body balance

- Late 1800's moral panics:
	- **Sanitation**
		- This time was characterized by mass pandemics and flu's due to a boom in population density and the emergence or critical sanitation issues
	- **Sexual propriety**
		- Booming population density saw men and women within the same small spaces (such as apartments) much more frequently; this was a concern for many conservatives as they saw this as a risk for elevated levels of casual sex
	- Temperance

- **Main idea that emerged is that nature and wilderness is the place we go to cure ourselves and our minds from the ills of the city**

# The Romanticism of Nature
- Post industrial revolution, society became disenchantment with industrialization
- Fear of the rise of urbanization
- Rising population densities brough about aranoia about immigration/disease/poverty
- Societal nostalgia for a rural past
- **Nature = purity**
- Emergence of the **rational recreation movement**

The Myth of Nature as a Medicinal/"Healing" Landscape:
	- Provides balance for mind and body
	- Restores energy dissipated by urban life
	- Renews relationship between "man" and "the land"
	- Cleanses life options

## Rational Recreation Movement
- **"Rational recreation"** was the ideal that nineteenth-century middle-class reformers hoped to impose on the urban working class of their day. They believed that **"leisure activities should be controlled, ordered, and improving"**
- Recreation was viewed as rational when it fosters personal self-improvement and, as a result, enhanced self-expression and personal and social identity. 
- Pursuing excellence in things like amateur tennis, hobbyist stamp collecting, or volunteer work with youth exemplifies rational recreation; whereas nonrational recreation—leisure that leads to no such acquisitions but, rather, is done for pure pleasure—is the classificatory home of activities like napping, strolling in the park, and, of course, watching television (primarily for entertainment).

# Neoliberal Governmentality
> Neoliberal ~ Ruled by free markets rather than government regulation; modern capitalism

- Under neoliberalism, individuals are "on their own" to earn money/protect their interests; **We dont expect the government to help and provide opportunities, jobs, welfare, subsidized education, and all other realms of social programming and support structures**
- Government or community not provide support
- We have come to think neoliberalist society is the natural order of things
- Neoliberalism is tricky because inequality persists; **the free capitalist marketplace doesnt work very well for people who are at a disadvantage**, monopolies grow and people are exploited

## What is "Governmentality"
- **Governmentality = assessment of the self**
- The management of the self - the "governing" of yourself
- The conduct of conduct
- How we manage/feel about ourselves - how we **CONTINUOUSLY** access/improve/optimize/critique ourselves
	- How one accesses their surroundings and compare ourselves to others; we are constantly monitoring ourselves and thinking "how am i, how do i want to be, where am i at"
- A theory made famous by **Michel Foucault**

### Foucault: "We internalize hegemonic power through our governmentality"
- The ways we assess ourselves reflects the power structures that surround us
- We **EXPERIENCE/EMBODY** the power of the hegemony through our governmentality
- **"how should a person be"**

# Neoliberal Governmentality = The Outsourcing of Wellbeing to the Individual Instead of the Group
- **YOU** and only **YOU** are responsible for your wellbeing
- You can't rely on a community, of government, or other network to help you feel "well" or happy
- You must continuously **WORK** on yourself - as though you are a product for sale, being continuously **UPGRADED**
- The power of the neoliberal marketplace is expressed through our desire to continuously self-improve
- Its as though we are each **products for sale**; we exist in a marketplace and try to make ourselves attractive for other consumers, **we think of ourselves as something to be continuously upgraded**, reflection of the way we are as consumers

# Leisure Hierarchies in a Neoliberal Hegemony

# Positive Psychology

# Happiness as Hobby/Leisure Practice

# Self-care as Neoliberal Practice
- We are all "neoliberal subjects" engaged in continuously governing ourselves
	- Self-care; self-help; self-improvement
	- Fitness trackers; personal bests; "#goals"
	- "Killing it"; "Crushing it"
	- Side-hustles; "passion projects"; "self-made" wealth

# Positive Psychology and Marginalized Subjects

# “Manifestation” and “Abundance Thinking”

# Reading Notes

## Rojek Chapter 1

## Rojek Chapter 3

### Kaplan's 7 Essential Elements of Leisure Experience
1. The psychological recognition of activity that is the antithesis of work
2. The identification of leisure with pleasure
3. Minimum involuntary role obligations
4. The psychological perception of freedom
5. The inclusion of an entire range of responses from inconsequence and insignificance to weightiness and importance
6. The general psychological recognition of play
7. The identification of activity as being close to the values of culture

### Habitus
> Habitus ~ The values and forms of practice associated with the originsand membership of individuals with specific social strata

- A key concept in **cultural reproduction**
- Habitus equips individuals with leisure dispositions that link individual trajectories of leisure practice with collective trajectories
- Associated with the sociology of **Pierre Bourdieu**; it's the basis for his theory of **cultural reproduction**
	- Cultural reproduction holds that institutional forms and patterns of practice are transmitted between generation to signify solidarity and difference vis-a-vie to other structures

## Koks, the World's Most Remote Foodie Destination
> Summary: This article explors Koks, a michelin star resturant located in the Farroe Islands that is known for extremely unique and controversial dishes that reflect the culture and food habits of the island. This includes several Farroese stapples such as fermented lamb, various sea birds, and local vegetation to create dishes that challenge the pallet of its patrons.

- Food leisure as spectacle
- Food as an expression of a cultures identity; **think about how Koks expresses the identity of the Farroe Islands**

## Carcooning: Life in the Fast-Food Lane
> Summary: Exploring the rising tendency for people to have meals in their cars; how cars ahve become a "second home" and car-convenience related products and services are booming due to a demand for convenience as disposable income rises in western society.

- New leisure market has emerged centered around car living or **"carcooning"**
- Convenience has become overvalued in modern society as disposable income rises
- Idea of the "sanctity of a meal" being challenged; car food as a means to an end
- Emerging car-focussed leisure practices lead to car industries adapting with additions such as cup holders releasing along with the popularity of drive-thrus in the 1960s and coolers

## Children of the Cube
> Summary: Author chronicles her sons interest in speedcubing and how it has helped him develop in social areas that he lacks due to autism. Beyond the narative the article talks about how the resurgence of rubix cubes and competitive outlets such as sports and other activities create a community that connects kids with simmilar interests.

- Group leisure
- Think about how these forms of leisure came to be, did the internet have a part in allowing mass amounts of people to connect on one specific niche activity?
