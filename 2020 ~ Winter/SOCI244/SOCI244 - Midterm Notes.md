# SOCI244 - Midterm Notes

# Essentialism
> Essentialism ~ Ideology that certain Humans have "essential" or "innate" qualities that create our specieis diversity. Essentially certain people are born with innate qualities that differ from other people

- Examples of essentialist thought:
	- "Men and women are "naturally" different"
	- "Women are naturally more nurturing than men"
	- "Black people are better at sports". 

# Psychologism
> Psychologism ~ Idea that psychology plays a central role in grounding or explaining some other, non-psychological type of fact or law.

# Constraints & Affordances
> Constraints ~ 

> Affordances ~ 

## Examples of Contraints & Affordances
- Examples of Constraints: No time; no money; social isolation; "hostile architecture" (urban design specifically installed to limit actions like public urination or public sleeping)
- Examples of Affordances: Affordable public transit; 30-hour workweek; affordable childcare

# The Theory of the “Leisure Society”
- Context: Increased industrialization and automation in 20th century
- Social theorists predicted that a **"Leisure Society"** would emerge in the late 20th century
- Thought that the emergaence of automation would mean people would no longer have to work
- Leisure would become the primary pastime; **a utopian society of only leisure**

## Common Pitfalls in Analyzing Leisure Practices
- Ideas about "well being" and "satisfaction" = essentialist/rely too much on psychologism
- Arguments about "freedom of choice" = do not acknowledge the presence of constraints/affordances

## Problems with the "Leisure Society" Theory
- The theory was soon debunked
	- It didn't ask any critical questions about leisure itself, **leisure FOR WHOME, HOW, WHY, AT WHAT COST?**
- It did not take into conideration the **GLOBAL COST** of leisure - the outsourcing of manufacturing/production that makes leisure among Westerners possible
- It was **fundamentally apolitical** - did not account for power/positionality/generationally permiating constraints
- The "Leisure Society" theory was **highly essentialist/psychologist**
	- Made major assumptions about what humans would do given unlimited leisure time
	- Did not account for bahaviours considered "depraved" such as:
		- Socially disengaged behaviour
		- Self-harming behaviour such as drug abuse and dangerous activities
		- "Anti-social" behaviour

# Social Capital
> Social Capital ~ Social capital is a positive product of human interaction. The positive outcome may be tangible or intangible and may include useful information, innovative ideas, and future opportunities.

- **Voluntary participation in community or civic well-being** grows ones social capital
	- Ex: Helping family, friends and neighbors; volunteering; coaching; taking part in creative activities
- Social capital is accumulated through the development of social networks
	- "Who you know"
- You can generate a "wealth" of social capital that benefit individuals in an increasingly social environment
- Acquiring social capital is instrumentalized in contemporary life; connection/networks are increasingly relevant to employment success
- Networking at social events is synonymous with acquiring social capital
- **Social capital = social influence**

## Social Capital Vs. Social "Reach"
- It's easy to confuse social capital with social media influence
- **Social capital is not easily lost**; it's based on a network of real-world relationships, exchanged favors, trust, reputation, and invested TIME
- Social "reach" is subject to an audience's taste
- The ease of the "unfollow" versus the work of creating/maintaining real-world relationships

## Social Capital’s Relationship to “Active Citizenship”
> Active Citizen ~ A citizen who takes an active role in the community (as in crime prevention and neighborhood watch); takes an active interest into the wellbeing of their own communities

- Active citizenship = "giving a shit"
- Relied on free flows of information/media, informing citizens about health risks, environmental conditions, etc
	- **No information means no activism**
- Active citizens work to make the world healthier. safer for leisure, which has major implications for leisure practice itself

- Examples of Active Citizenship:
	- Research on smoking/bans on smoking
	- Research on impact of alcohol/drunk driving; social norms about alcohol consumption changing (MADD)
	- Littering/pollution regulations
	- Hunting for animals as bygone practice
	- Animal fighting as bygone practice
	- Carbon emissions concerns
	- Concerns about smartphone addiction

### Pre-Globalization: "Safety" Concerns Related to the SELF
- **Contemporary "safety" concerns tend to relate to OTHERS and the ENVIRONMENT as well**
- These concerns are the result of ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, which is bound up with our need to accumulate SOCIAL CAPITAL to survive

# Flow States
- Humans are understood to enter a "flow" state during sustained, focused activity that is challenging but manageable
	- Challenging/engaging activities provide a sense of fullfillment and satisfaction with the self
- "Flow" can be achieved across all kinds of leisure activities
- "Flow" is a useful concept to descrive the "enjoyable" aspects of leisure; why do we enjoy certain activities more than other? Why are we sometimes bored/anxious versus engaged/happy? Its because of flow
- **Many leisure practices can be understood as pursuits of "flow" within certain constraints**

## Flow as a Morally Empty Concept
- Flow is a state people can achieve when they are harming each other and themselves
	- Serial killers, drug addicts, people who neglect their families in favor of selfish pursuits
- "Flow" is a useful way to understand what makes some things fun and other things boring, but it's not a morally sound "goal" in and of itself

## Flow Opportunities
- Flow can be achieved in a variety of circumstances
- Activities where a flow state can be achieved:
	- Sports
	- Chess
	- Puzzles
	- Casual sex (that is not used for social ordering.mainting a hierarchy, as it is among most mammals)
	- Games
	- Art

# Webs of Interdependence
- We all exist within networks/webs of interdependence
- No one makes leisure choices that are not influenced by others/have no influence on others
- Leisure never occurs in a vacuum. It often has unintended consequences

- Webs of interdependence include:
	- Location
	- Class
	- Gender identity
	- Racial identity
	- Social capital
	- Historical context
	- Many others

# Mythogenesis
- Development and reproduction of narratives that dramatizes world visions/senses of community into compelling metaphors
- A selective and seductive account of human action upon nature and culture
- Landscape/battles/wars/victories/"God's plan"
- Myth transform these into markers of **CULTURAL/RACE IDENTITY**

# Myth vs. Ideology
- **Ideology is historically based**, **while myth is faith-based**
- Ideology functions to legitimate dominance of one group over another
- Myth functions to delineate inclusion into a group

## Examples of Myths & Ideologies
- **Myths:**
	- The Aryan race of the Nazis
	- "Manifest Destiny" in the United States
- **Ideologies:**
	- Working-class heritage is not as worthy of preservation as elite heritage
	- Wealth is the result of moral superiority
- **Myths exist as STORIES; ideologies exist as ARGUMENTS**

## Ideologies and myths are inscribed in the landscape
- There is no such thing as a "mythless space"
- Even wild nature - it's "preserved" to represent the mythological past before human development. The "wilderness" is myth
- It represents a "timeless" reality that precedes humans

## Myth is hard to analyze because it is so embedded in our perspective...
- But historical perspective helps
- Romantic period (early 1800's) art, poetry, literature, and music romanticized wild places 
	- During the romantic period nature was turned into a series of aesthetics that turns into themes and sights and this all started with the romantics
- Wild nature represented truth, emotional honesty - cutting through the "artifice" of city life. The aestheticization of nature

## Myths of the Late 1800's - Rational Recreation Movement
- Fresh air and exercise = morally correct
- "Healthy leisure" an antidote to moral corruption (drugs, sex, other immoral acts)
- Based on this belief, nature = fresh air = mind/body balance

- Late 1800's moral panics:
	- **Sanitation**
		- This time was characterized by mass pandemics and flu's due to a boom in population density and the emergence or critical sanitation issues
	- **Sexual propriety**
		- Booming population density saw men and women within the same small spaces (such as apartments) much more frequently; this was a concern for many conservatives as they saw this as a risk for elevated levels of casual sex
	- Temperance

- **Main idea that emerged is that nature and wilderness is the place we go to cure ourselves and our minds from the ills of the city**

# The Romanticism of Nature
- Post industrial revolution, society became disenchantment with industrialization
- Fear of the rise of urbanization
- Rising population densities brough about aranoia about immigration/disease/poverty
- Societal nostalgia for a rural past
- **Nature = purity**
- Emergence of the **rational recreation movement**

## The Myth of Nature as a Medicinal/"Healing" Landscape
- Provides balance for mind and body
- Restores energy dissipated by urban life
- Renews relationship between "man" and "the land"
- Cleanses life options

## Rational Recreation Movement

# Neoliberal Governmentality

# The Entrepreneurial Self
- Idea of the **Entrepreneural Self**, that has emerged in the modern age; marketting yourself as a product that exists within a market, **"hustle culture"**
