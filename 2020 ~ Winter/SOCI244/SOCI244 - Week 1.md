# SOCI244 - Week 1

- Idea of the **Entrepreneural Self**, that has emerged in the modern age; marketting yourself, "hustle culture"

# Historical Leisure Context
- Agrarian
	- Colonial times of indigenous Canada, Settlers in colonial canada
	- French monarchy, ruling class with leisure practices that differ from working class
- Industrial Revolution (1850s)
	- People flocked to urban centers to make a living; capitalism was providing oportunities that did not exist otherwise; rise of population density in urban areas cause increased illecit leisure activities
- Post-WWII
	- Beginning of conformist middle class, "white picket fence" nuclear household; emergence of "counter-culture" and people start to organize themselves by conformist and alternative peoples
- Today
	- Capitalism has begun so ingraned into the cultural conciousness that it becomes incorporated into our moral/value system through consumer buy power as a facet of their moralls

# What is Leisure?
- **Voluntary behaviour that is done without compensation**
- What we CAN'T ASSUME about leisure:
	- That is had to do with "well-being" or "satisfaction"
	- That is had to do with "freedom of choice"

# Four Important Terms
> Essentialism ~ Ideology that certain Humans have "essential" or "innate" qualities that create our specieis diversity. Essentially certain people are born with innate qualities that differ from other people

## Examples of Essentialist Thought
- "Men and women are "naturally" different"
- "women are naturally more nurturing than men"
- "black people are better at sports". 

> Psychologism ~ There's a "psychological" explanation for certain leisure practices. The idea that people seek out certain stimuli because of psychological need

> Constraints ~ Environmental or social factors that shape/influence/limit our choices and behaviours; something that constrains behviours/actions/activities

> Affordances ~ Things that are made possible/brought into being that provide new opportunities; something that promotes/provides opportunities/convenience

## Examples of Constraints/Affordances
- Constraints: No time; no money; social isolation; "hostile architecture" (urban design specifically installed to limit actions like public urination or public sleeping)
- Affordances: Affordable public transit; 30-hour workweek; affordable childcare

# Common Pitfalls in Analyzing Leisure Practices
- Ideas about "well being" and "satisfaction" = essentialist/rely too much on psychologism
- Arguments about "freedom of choice" = do not acknowledge the presence of constraints/affordances

# The Theory of "The Leisure Society" (1930s)
- Context: Increased industrialization and automation in 20th century
- Social theorists predicted that a **"Leisure Society"** would emerge in the late 20th century
- Thought that the emergaence of automation would mean people would no longer have to work
- Leisure would become the primary pastime

## Problems with the "Leisure Society" Theory
- The theory was soon debunked
	- It didn't ask any critical questions about leisure itself - leisure FOR WHOME, HOW, WHY and AT WHAT COST?
- It did not take into conideration the **GLOBAL COST** of leisure - the outsourcing of manufacturing/production that makes leisure among Westerners possible
- It was fundamentally apolitical - did not account for power/positionality
- The "Leisure Society" theory was **highly essentialist/psychologist**
	- Made major assumptions about what humans would do given unlimited leisure time
	- Did not account for bahaviours considered "depraved" such as:
		- Socially disengaged behaviour
		- Self-harming behaviour such as drug abuse and dangerous activities
		- "Anti-social" behaviour

# Consequences of Mass Automation
- AI is replacing human employees on a massive scale
- However, neoliberal capitalism requires that individuals earn ever-increasing incomes to survive

> Neoliberal/Neoliberalism ~ associated with policies of economic liberalization, including privatization, deregulation, free trade, austerity, and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society

- Despite this the "end of work" is nowhere in sight, work is and will be a neccesity for the forseeable future
- Many people have neither meaningful work NOR the opportunity to pursue meaningful leisure

# Globalization

> Globalization ~ the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale

- Globalization increases with time as advances in technology make connections with the world on a global scale more accessible such as the development of the internet or transportaion

## Pre-Globalization
- Pre-globalization, Westerners worked in manufacturing/agriculture. Now, most of us work in knowledge/service/health care industries
- Pre-globalization, leisure was more often an END IN ITSELF
- It was what we did when we were NOT WORKING: Relaxation; hobbies; socialization; transgression

## Post-Globalization
- Work is mostly limited to within the knowledge/healthcare/service sectors
- Exposed to unlimited mass communications
- Take travel and mobility for granted (pre-globalization, travel was a luxury - a leisure pastime for elites)
- Spend much more time in educational institutions
- Are competing for ever-fewer stable jobs

# Uneven Distribution of Leisure
- Global inequality & local income inequality limit access to meaningful leisure activities
- Leisure and professional success are TIGHTLY LINKED
	- Ex: Silicon Valley parents raising "tech free" kids
		- Why are they doing this? What makes this leisure choice possible?
