# SOCI244 - Week 11

# What Does Odell mean by "Doing Nothing"
- Odell refers to "nothing" as an active engaged form of experience; **Experiencing nothing**
- In modern society the state of distraction is permanent and often sought after, we WANT to be distracted and this tendency is something we need to stray away from according to Odell
- Refusing the concept of "productivity" that characterizes modern culture defined by neoliberal governmentality,  
- Enhancing our awareness of **our body in place** and the **place around us** (embodiment & emplacement)
- Odell is also interested in **"repairing"** our attention by maintaining these times of **"nothingness"** to think, reflect, heal, sustain, etc. through **practicing being unstimulated within these settings of nothingness**

## "Doing Nothing" vs. Mindfulness
- While it may seem similar, mindfulness is more and more a form of productivity, improving oneself, in order to improve other aspects of ones life.

# What Counts as "Nothing"
- Engaging the senses without **deliberate stimulus from media**, **being in full control** in what your mind and body is engaging with
	- Looking, listening, thinking, noticing

# Why does Odell Consider "Doing Nothing" as an act of Resistance?
- The hegemony of productivity encourages to think of our time as a vessel to be filled
	- Doing nothing is seen as an **act of defiance** as it does not produce "value" in any quantifiable sense, **it does not improve the self as a product to be marketed**
- The hegemony of the **attention economy** monopolizes our awareness and monetizes our eyeball-motion (i.e. attention)
- **Leisure hierarchies are irrelevant to Odell**; Time "wasted" (leisure practices that don't immediately better oneself) vs. time "well spent" (leisure practices that are traditionally seen as productive such as reading, exercising, etc.) is a distinction that Odell sees as problematic.
	- Basically our leisure time should not have components with ulterior moves to better contribute and improve production within society as an individual, leisure should just be leisure which is NOT the case in modern society

> Attention Economy ~ 

# Odell Seeks out Spaces that are not "Containers" for Guided Behavior
- Most spaces are designated for commercial use
- Where can a person do nothing in public?
	- Parks are precious public spaces for doing nothing, they exist as a **third space** outside commercial exploitation
		- The act of doing nothing at a park is socially acceptable while doing the same things outside such a setting is seen as unproductive; it seems staring at the sky is only okay when there is grass around you

# Listening and "Doing Nothing"
- Media platforms we use to communicate do not encourage "listening"
	- Tend to encourage coming up with quick responses, loud attention grabbing opinions, etc
- Listening and "doing nothing" pushes back against these systems of over stimulus stimulus and attention exploitation

# Rhetoric of "Growth"
- Neoliberal idea that time is money - therefor all our time (leisure time) should be "well spent" on continuous self-improvement
	- There is an obligation to never be satisfied and always improving for the sake of gain; **forced progress**
- Doing nothing resists this pressure for **forced progress** by spending leisure time doing things that do not produce value or increase ones standing; **Encourages us to develop thoughts outside of an engagement with progress**

# Reading Notes: Odell Chapter 1
- Main idea is about the importance of doing nothing as a wellness practice to contrast a modern lifestyle characterized by over stimulation

> Deep Listening ~ Listening to each and every sound surrounding one, going beyond "hearing" and truly taking in the stimuli of the world around oneself, particularly in things such as nature settings; listening with a bodily awareness for everything.

- Importance of deliberately doing nothing to combat the over-stimulus of modern life & technology and prevalence of the **attention economy**

# Reading Notes: Odell Chapter 3
- Main idea is about the deliberate refusal of norms
- It is not the lack of work that concerns fellow colleagues of **The Trainee**, it is the deliberate refusal to abide by social norms, the very act of doing something abnormal is frightening to those who exist within the status quo
- Diogenes as the first performance artist, shocking people our of habitual norms through the deliberate reversal of anything and everything considered "normal"
	- This included walking down the street backwards, being asked to be buried upside down, moving a tub around in public aimlessly to look busy in a social panic, etc.

> McEvilley on Diogenes... "Diogenes's general theme was the complete and immediate reversal of all familiar values, on the grounds that they are automatizing forces which cloud more of life than they reveal"

- Acts such as The Trainee, Diogenes's ancient antics, and other performance art that challenges deep-rooted customs shows how fragile such traditions are as the challenging of such traditions brings about such uproar and controversy; customary behavior is fragile much like how masculinity can be fragile when challenged with behaviors/interactions/ideas that contradict the socially rigid bounds for whats acceptable.
- **To refuse a norm is to challenge it**; criticism through refusal to be complicit to the thoughtless habitual practices of society
	- **This means the refusal to do what is expected**, in the case of Diogenes if asked a yes no question, he would not refuse and reply in the negative he would reply with something unrelated entirely, refusing the premise of the question itself.
- Example of Bartleby's famous response of **"I would prefer not to"** that refuses even the premise of the questions providing absolutely no information when prompted for such info
