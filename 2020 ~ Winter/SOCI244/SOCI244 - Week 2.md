# SOCI244 - Week 2

# Leisure is Unevenly Distributed
- Global inequality
- Local income inequality
- Leisure and professional success are **TIGHTLY LINKED**
	- Ex: Silicon valley execs raising "tech free" kids

## What does this Mean for Leisure
- We are concerned with the accumulation of **social capital** in addition to **income** as part of our efforts to **succeed**
- **SOCIAL CAPITAL is accumulated through leisure pursuits**
- **SOCIAL CAPITAL is crucial for upward mobility**

# Social Capital
> Social Capital ~ Social capital is a positive product of human interaction. The positive outcome may be tangible or intangible and may include useful information, innovative ideas, and future opportunities.

- **Voluntary participation in community or civic well-being**
	- Ex: Helping family, friends and neighbors; volunteering; coaching; taking part in creative activities
- Social capital is accumulated through the development of social networks
	- "Who you know"
- You can generate a "wealth" of social capital that benefit individuals in an increasingly social environment
- Acquiring social capital is instrumentalized in contemporary life; connection/networks are increasingly relevant to employment success
- Networking at social events is synonymous with acquiring social capital
- **Social capital = social influence**

## Social Capital Vs. Social "Reach"
- It's easy to confuse social capital with social media influence
- **Social capital is not easily lost**; it's based on a network of real-world relationships, exchanged favors, trust, reputation, and invested TIME
- Social "reach" is subject to an audience's taste
- The ease of the "unfollow" versus the work of creating/maintaining real-world relationships

## Active Citizenship is Crucial for Accumulating Social Capital
> Active Citizen ~ A citizen who takes an active role in the community (as in crime prevention and neighborhood watch); takes an active interest into the wellbeing of their own communities

- Active citizenship = "giving a shit"
- Relied on free flows of information/media, informing citizens about health risks, environmental conditions, etc
- No information means no activism
- Active citizens work to make the world healthier. safer for leisure, which has major implications for leisure practice itself

### Examples of Active Citizenship
- Research on smoking/bans on smoking
- Research on impact of alcohol/drunk driving; social norms about alcohol consumption changing (MADD)
- Littering/pollution regulations
- Hunting for animals as bygone practice
- Animal fighting as bygone practice
- Carbon emissions concerns
- Concerns about smartphone addiction

### Pre-Globalization: "Safety" Concerns Related to the SELF
- **Contemporary "safety" concerns tend to relate to OTHERS and the ENVIRONMENT as well**
- These concerns are the result of ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, which is bound up with our need to accumulate SOCIAL CAPITAL to survive

# Concept of "Peak Enjoyment" or "Flow"
- Humans are understood to enter a "flow" state during sustained, focused activity that is challenging but manageable
	- Challenging/engaging activities provide a sense of fullfillment and satisfaction with the self
- "Flow" can be achieved across all kinds of leisure activities
- "Flow" is a useful concept to descrive the "enjoyable" aspects of leisure; why do we enjoy certain activities more than other? Why are we sometimes bored/anxious versus engaged/happy? Its because of flow
