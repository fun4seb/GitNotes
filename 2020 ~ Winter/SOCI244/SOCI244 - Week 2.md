# SOCI244 - Week 2

# Leisure is Unevenly Distributed
- Global inequality
- Local income inequality
- Leisure and professional success are **TIGHTLY LINKED**
	- Ex: Silicon valley execs raising "tech free" kids

## What does this Mean for Leisure
- We are concerned with the accumulation of **social capital** in addition to **income** as part of our efforts to **succeed**
- **SOCIAL CAPITAL is accumulated through leisure pursuits**
- **SOCIAL CAPITAL is crucial for upward mobility**

# Social Capital
> Social Capital ~ Social capital is a positive product of human interaction. The positive outcome may be tangible or intangible and may include useful information, innovative ideas, and future opportunities.

- **Voluntary participation in community or civic well-being** grows ones social capital
	- Ex: Helping family, friends and neighbors; volunteering; coaching; taking part in creative activities
- Social capital is accumulated through the development of social networks
	- "Who you know"
- You can generate a "wealth" of social capital that benefit individuals in an increasingly social environment
- Acquiring social capital is instrumentalized in contemporary life; connection/networks are increasingly relevant to employment success
- Networking at social events is synonymous with acquiring social capital
- **Social capital = social influence**

## Social Capital Vs. Social "Reach"
- It's easy to confuse social capital with social media influence
- **Social capital is not easily lost**; it's based on a network of real-world relationships, exchanged favors, trust, reputation, and invested TIME
- Social "reach" is subject to an audience's taste
- The ease of the "unfollow" versus the work of creating/maintaining real-world relationships

## Active Citizenship is Crucial for Accumulating Social Capital
> Active Citizen ~ A citizen who takes an active role in the community (as in crime prevention and neighborhood watch); takes an active interest into the wellbeing of their own communities

- Active citizenship = "giving a shit"
- Relied on free flows of information/media, informing citizens about health risks, environmental conditions, etc
- No information means no activism
- Active citizens work to make the world healthier. safer for leisure, which has major implications for leisure practice itself

### Examples of Active Citizenship
- Research on smoking/bans on smoking
- Research on impact of alcohol/drunk driving; social norms about alcohol consumption changing (MADD)
- Littering/pollution regulations
- Hunting for animals as bygone practice
- Animal fighting as bygone practice
- Carbon emissions concerns
- Concerns about smartphone addiction

### Pre-Globalization: "Safety" Concerns Related to the SELF
- **Contemporary "safety" concerns tend to relate to OTHERS and the ENVIRONMENT as well**
- These concerns are the result of ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, which is bound up with our need to accumulate SOCIAL CAPITAL to survive

# Concept of "Peak Enjoyment" or "Flow"
- Humans are understood to enter a "flow" state during sustained, focused activity that is challenging but manageable
	- Challenging/engaging activities provide a sense of fullfillment and satisfaction with the self
- "Flow" can be achieved across all kinds of leisure activities
- "Flow" is a useful concept to descrive the "enjoyable" aspects of leisure; why do we enjoy certain activities more than other? Why are we sometimes bored/anxious versus engaged/happy? Its because of flow
- **Many leisure practices can be understood as pursuits of "flow" within certain constraints**

## Flow as a Morally Empty Concept
- Flow is a state people can achieve when they are harming each other and themselves
	- Serial killers, drug addicts, people who neglect their families in favor of selfish pursuits
- "Flow" is a useful way to understand what makes some things fun and other things boring, but it's not a morally sound "goal" in and of itself

## Flow Opportunities
- Flow can be achieved in a variety of circumstances
- Activities where a flow state can be achieved:
	- Sports
	- Chess
	- Puzzles
	- Casual sex (that is not used for social ordering.mainting a hierarchy, as it is among most mammals)
	- Games
	- Art

# Webs of Interdependence
- We all exist within networks/webs of interdependence
- No one makes leisure choices that are not influenced by others/have no influence on others
- Leisure never occurs in a vacuum. It often has unintended consequences
- Webs of interdependence include:
	- Location
	- Class
	- Gender identity
	- Racial identity
	- Social capital
	- Historical context
	- Many others

# Reading Notes: Rojek Chapter 3

## Kaplan's 7 Essential Elements of Leisure Experience
1. The psychological recognition of activity that is the antithesis of work
2. The identification of leisure with pleasure
3. Minimum involuntary role obligations
4. The psychological perception of freedom
5. The inclusion of an entire range of responses from inconsequence and insignificance to weightiness and importance
6. The general psychological recognition of play
7. The identification of activity as being close to the values of culture

## Habitus
> Habitus ~ The values and forms of practice associated with the originsand membership of individuals with specific social strata

- A key concept in **cultural reproduction**
- Habitus equips individuals with leisure dispositions that link individual trajectories of leisure practice with collective trajectories
- Associated with the sociology of **Pierre Bourdieu**; it's the basis for his theory of **cultural reproduction**
	- Cultural reproduction holds that institutional forms and patterns of practice are transmitted between generation to signify solidarity and difference vis-a-vie to other structures
	
## Discusion Questions
- Discussion questions based off of the readings (Rojek: Chapter 3)

### Question 1: How are we "Magnetically" pulled into making our leisure choices?
- Leisure performs functions:
	- Cultural reproduction/social control
		- Belonging to a cultural leisure group into adulthood; **Bordieu explored this concept**; happens at all levels such as within the family (how one is raised); maintaints conventions; regulatory, functions to keep people behaving in certain ways over time
	- Declaration of identity/social belonging
	- Resistance to social control
	- Satisfaction of commodity fetish (consumerism/urge to be an active consumer)
- We are "magnetically" pulled into leisure practices in part to satisfy these functions

### Questions 2: What is the Balance Between Scarcity and Surplus?
- It is being **continually re-negotiated** through leisure practice
	- peoples' leisure practice is always a response to a specific scarcity or surplus

#### Scarcity or surplus of representation/identity
- Behavioural conventions
- Boundaries of inclusion/exclusion

#### Scarcity or surplus of resistance/control
- Regulation of lifestyle options/reinforcements of soical norms
- Resistance to agents of control

### Questions 3: How is Leisure Declarative
- It's how we **declare** our **allegiance**
- We seek to align ourselves with certain groups, tastes, classes, histories
- Leisure is where people make the most declarations and cement their identity and views

### Question 4: How might this "Critically Reflexive Self" Work in our own Social Contexts? How do we Monitor our own Behaviours
- **When leisure is used for social control, we develop a "critically reflexive self" to monitor our own behaviour**
- In a capitalist social regime, we are self-optimizing toward increased **earning potential**
	- We are expected to be in charge of our own success (things such as nepotism is forwned upon); **deeply neo-liberal value**
- We all possess this potential; we are in charge of **developing it**

### Question 5: We Tend to be Addicted to work; We fetishize commodities, We Measure Worth Based on Material Possessions, What is Enough?
- Millennials and Gen Z have broken from this trend - TIME more valuable than MONEY
	- **Represents a huge cultural shift in values**
- Bit is it possible to fetishize **EXPERIENCES**, and is that any better than fetishizing **THINGS**?
	- Idea of collecting experiences, **photos as commodity**, etc.

### Question 6: What's the Connection Between Leisure, Production, and Consumption in the Internet Age?
- We are all **prosumers** (we both produce and consume such as posting and viewing social media)
- The rise of the **entrepreneurial self**
	- We cannot just say we like things, we must post and provide evidence and show people our lifestyles; build our social image/reputation
- **performing** leisure for an audience of potential consumers

### Question 7: How can Leisure Practices Resist Social Inequality?
- **Resisting privatization of leisure spaces**
- Using public services and spending times in places meant for everyone (YMCA public instrituations, etc.) - breaking rank from ones social class
