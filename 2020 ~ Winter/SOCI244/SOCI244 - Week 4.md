# SOCI244 - Week 4: When is Food Leisure?

# What else can leisure practices be? They can be types of CODING and REPRESENTATION
- Leisure is not morally neutral in capitalist societies
- it is EARNED through work/it is meaningless outside the context of work
- Capitalist choice ensures our "freedom" (relative to non-capitalist regimes)

- Hard work = the earning power to CHOOSE one's leisure pursuits/be "free"

## What forms of leisure exist beyond capitalist boundaries?
- Leisure combined with shared care-work (volunteerism)
- Communal living
- Shared commodities (cars/spoting goods)
