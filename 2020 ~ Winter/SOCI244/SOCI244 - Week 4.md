# SOCI244 - Week 4

# What else can leisure practices be? They can be types of CODING and REPRESENTATION
- Leisure is not morally neutral in capitalist societies
- it is EARNED through work/it is meaningless outside the context of work
- Capitalist choice ensures our "freedom" (relative to non-capitalist regimes)
- This freedom is enacted during our leisure time

# Capitalism

## Capitalism gets its sheen from the leisure opportunities it promises, not from the opportunities to work
- Hard work = the earning power to CHOOSE one's leisure pursuits/be "free"
- To reject work/rely on social services is to be marginal
- This morality evoles into -> "leisure" of the wageless = crime

## There is a positive connection between leisure and freedom in the West
- Inhibits reform to any existing capitalist system
- The "freedom of choice" under capitalism becomes a social
- This makes attempts to envision leisure beyond capitalist boundaries seem suspect/illegitimate

## What forms of leisure exist beyond capitalist boundaries?
- Leisure combined with shared care-work (volunteerism)
- Communal living
- Shared commodities (cars/spoting goods)
