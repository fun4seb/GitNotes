# SOCI244 - Week 6: Tourism, Themeing, and Myths

- Coding and representation part 2: markers, myths

# In a media-saturated society, tourism is a highly mediated pastime
- It is not simply a questions of traveling to new places
- It is a form of consumption of objects
- The consumption of objects occurs in how we **SEE** them, how we **CAPTURE** them, and how we **BROADCAST** them
- **Media has become an integral part of the tourism experience**
	- Ex: People lining up on the Everest summit to take pictures, pictures of the Joker staircase dancing scene location
	- Media influences tourism patterns

# Tourism is a leisure practice based on SIGHTS
- What is a **SIGHT** (Ex: Eiffel Tower)
- A symbolic marker that contains many meanings **CONDENSED** into one objects
- Tourists do not **SEE** Paris - they see **SIGHTS** that **REPRESENT** PARIS
- They seek visual information that **CONFIRMS** existing symbolic representations of Paris
- Tourism = seeking sights that **MATCH** the symbolic identity of a place
- Each place has a set of sights that tourists are expected to consume
	- This could include specific "beach" sights and all that encompasses that (umbrellas, white sand, ocean horizon, etc.)
- A tourists "authentic experience" of "doing a country" is an entirely uniquely tourist experience

> Hegemony ~ Leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others

# Satisfaction of tourism based on this idea of matching experience with expectations
- To orient oneself in opposition - "off the beaten path" - nonetheless is defined by prevailing approach
- Seeking a symbolic match for "authenticity" rather than "tourism" is the same leisure practice

# Theming

## Leisure spaces can be "themed" around certain preferred behaviors
> Theming ~ symbolic use of visual cues within a space to define it for the people who inhabit it; fulfills expectations for what any space is; theming defines the space

- Commercial leisure spaces can be **CONTAINERS** for human interaction
	- Ex: Casinos, Disneyland, nightclubs, shopping malls, all-inclusive resorts, etc. are all **CONATINERS** for human interaction
- Objects are arrayed within the container to encourage humans to behave in desired ways
	- Ex: Free buffet in casinos = keep people gambling longer
- Convenience works both ways
- The way a tourist environment is themed cultivates an image of any one place a tourist might visit; theming characterizes the type of experiences any space provides (Ex: vacation to Disneyland is viewed different to a vacation to Mexico due to how each experience and setting is uniquely themed)

## The theming of activities in public space = increasingly controlled by commercial imperatives
- Cities cant afford to maintain large amounts if space for free leisure without corporate sponsorship/help
- Corporations by space/presence in urban leisure spaces (parks, sports stadiums, public squares)
- Virtually no space in urban public space is not oriented toward commercial interests

## Themed environments must appeal to the broadest population for profit maximization
- Public space has become a place of **consumer communion**
- If the imperative is to reach the highest number of consumers, the number signs/themes must be limited so as to be inclusive

## Theming doesn't ONLY serve capitalist interests - it can serve to SUBVERT too
- Gang, drug, and social resistance subcultures use **THEMEING** too
- Theming itself is not a capitalist practice
	- Money is not always required to theme a space
- Theming often draws from pre-capitalist images and stories - AKA **SHARED MYTHS**

# Myths

## Mythogenesis
- Development and reproduction of narratives that dramatizes world visions/senses of community into compelling metaphors
- A selective and seductive account of human action upon nature and culture
- Landscape/battles/wars/victories/"God's plan"
- Myth transform these into markers of **CULTURAL/RACE IDENTITY**

## Myths are not ideology
- Ideology is historically based
- Myth is faith-based
- Ideology functions to legitimate dominance of one group over another
- Myth functions to delineate inclusion into a group

## Examples of myths
- Examples of myths:
	- The Aryan race of the Nazis
	- "Manifest Destiny" in the United States
- Examples of ideologies:
	- Working-class heritage is not as worthy of preservation as elite heritage
	- Wealth is the result of moral superiority
- **Myths exist as STORIES; ideologies exist as ARGUMENTS**

## Ideologies and myths are inscribed in the landscape
- There is no such thing as a "mythless space"
- Even wild nature - it's "preserved" to represent the mythological past before human development. The "wilderness" is myth
- It represents a "timeless" reality that precedes humans

## Myth is hard to analyze because it is so embedded in our perspective...
- But historical perspective helps
- Romantic period (early 1800's) art, poetry, literature, and music romanticized wild places 
	- During the romantic period nature was turned into a series of aesthetics that turns into themes and sights and this all started with the romantics
- Wild nature represented truth, emotional honesty - cutting through the "artifice" of city life. The aestheticization of nature

## Myths of the Late 1800's - Rational Recreation Movement
- Fresh air and exercise = morally correct
- "Healthy leisure" an antidote to moral corruption (drugs, sex, other immoral acts)
- Based on this belief, nature = fresh air = mind/body balance
- Late 1800's moral panics:
	- Sanitation
		- This time was characterized by mass pandemics and flu's due to a boom in population density and the emergence or critical sanitation issues
	- Sexual propriety
		- Booming population density saw men and women within the same small spaces (such as apartments) much more frequently; this was a concern for many conservatives as they saw this as a risk for elevated levels of casual sex
	- Temperance
- **Main idea that emerged is that nature and wilderness is the place we go to cure ourselves and our minds from the ills of the city**

## Romanticism and Rational Recreation Movements distrust the city
- Disenchantment with industrialization
- Fear of the rise of urbanization
- Paranoia about immigration/disease/poverty
- Nostalgia for a rural past
- **Nature = purity**

## The Myth of Nature as medicinal landscape
- Provides balance for mind and body
- Restores energy dissipated by urban life
- Renews relationship between "man" and "the land"
- Cleanses life options
