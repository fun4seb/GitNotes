# SOCI244 - Week 7: Self-Improvement: Where Work & Leisure Meet

# What is "Neoliberal Governmentality""
> Neoliberal ~ Ruled by free markets rather than government regulation

- Under neoliberalism, individuals are "on their own" to earn money/protect their interests; **We dont expect the government to help and provide opportunities, jobs, welfare, subsidized education, and all other realms of social programming and support structures**
- Government or community not provide support
- We have come to think neoliberalist society is the natural order of things
- Neoliberalism is tricky because inequality persists; **the free capitalist marketplace doesnt work very well for people who are at a disadvantage**, monopolies grow and people are exploited

## What is "Governmentality"
- **Governmentality = assessment of the self**
- The management of the self - the "governing" of yourself
- The conduct of conduct
- How we manage/feel about ourselves - how we **CONTINUOUSLY** access/improve/optimize/critique ourselves
	- How one accesses their surroundings and compare ourselves to others; we are constantly monitoring ourselves and thinking "how am i, how do i want to be, where am i at"
- A theory made famous by **Michel Foucault**

### Foucault: "We internalize hegemonic power through our governmentality"
- The ways we assess ourselves reflects the power structures that surround us
- We **EXPERIENCE/EMBODY** the power of the hegemony through our governmentality
- "how should a person be"

# Neoliberal Governmentality = The Outsourcing of Wellbeing to the Individual Instead of the Group
- **YOU** and only **YOU** are responsible for your wellbeing
- You can't rely on a community, of government, or other network to help you feel "well" or happy
- You must continuously **WORK** on yourself - as though you are a product for sale, being continuously **UPGRADED**
- The power of the neoliberal marketplace is expressed through our desire to continuously self-improve
- Its as though we are each **products for sale**; we exist in a marketplace and try to make ourselves attractive for other consumers, **we think of ourselves as something to be continuously upgraded**, reflection of the way we are as consumers

# Neoliberal Governmentality is the Defining Spirit of our Age
- We are all "neoliberal subjects" engaged in continuously governing ourselves
	- Self-care; self-help; self-improvement
	- Fitness trackers; personal bests; "#goals"
	- "Killing it"; "Crushing it"
	- Side-hustles; "passion projects"; "self-made" wealth
