# GEOG290 - Week 11: Markets & The State

# Review Part 1: The world of eco-modernists (EM's) and the magic of decoupling
1. EM's assume that human well being is dependent on consumption, which degrades the environment
2. For EM's, with improved technology and especially cheaper energy, the link between well being and environmental degradation can be decoupled, in other words, economic growth at much lower environmental cost
3. For the EM's decoupling will lead nature to be spared without having to sacrifice human well being
4. The eco-modernists authorize themselves to make the big decisions about the future of life on earth
- Examples include: urbanization and agricultural intensification and the uses of hoped for technologies include nuclear fusion and large scale carbon capture; wind and solar virtually ignored

- "There is too much infighting"
    - How do we think about combing different environmental strategies
    - What are some points of convergence that we have found so far
    - Where do we draw the line? What are the deal breakers for environmental solutions?

# Review Part 2: Imagining a future world of governance and political economy, with or without the state and market
- Four potential social formations (from Wainwright and Mann, 2013)
    - Climate Leviathan = capitalist, planetary sovereignty
    - Climate Mao = non-capitalist, planetary sovereignty    
    - Climate Behemoth = capitalist, anti-planetary sovereignty
    - Climate X = non-capitalist, anti-planetary sovereignty

- Materialist (Marxian) approach; **Climate Leviathan**
    - Material conditions, in this case, the effects of climate change will create the conditions for new political economic systems

- What if reduction in carbon emissions were enforced by military rather than with economic incentives?; **Climate Mao**
    - Contradiction as the military is a large polluter; capitalism (and its consequences) and the military industrial complex work hand in hand

- Imagining the world with capitalism, but without states; **Climate Behemoth**

- Climate X?
    - Collection of semi-autonomous processes and social movements that are loosely connected to create different kinds of solutions that fit each individual context
        - Not top-down plant; no planetary organization managing everything

- **Summary:**
    - All these change in the climate could produce changes in governance
    - Climate Leviathan uses markets to regulate environmental bads
    - Climate Leviathan leaves most existing institutions intact
    - Where are we now, which square in the matrix?

# Markets to the Rescue: The Mechanics of Climate Leviathan
- Bet between Simon vs. Ehrlich: A world of scarcity vs. a world of choices
    - Commodity = something that can be **bought and sold** in a **capitalist market**
    - What are fictitious commodities?
    - Ehrlich loses

# Regulating Environmental Bads with Markets
- **Coase theorem** = the most efficient way to respond to **market failure** is through contractual negotiations
    - Coase theorem represents an alternative approach to regulation by the state to fix environmental problems
    - Coase theorem only works when property rights are clear and protected, transaction costs are 0, and where all parties have access to complete information
    - **Market failure** = refers to situations where the market does not produce efficient outcomes, often because of spillover effects of market activities, known as externalities. Why might climate change be described as the biggest market failure in history?
        - Climate change is a market failure in the sense that the institutions that cause climate change are not paying for it, the consumers are; they are not holding up their end of the bargain/transaction and the system is not working as intended (producing efficient results)

# 3 Common Market-Based Solutions to Environmental Problems
1. Green tax = individuals or firms participate in "greener" behavior by avoiding more costly "brown" alternatives
2. Cap and trade = Total amount of pollutant or other "bad" is limited and tradeable rights to pollute are distributed to polluters; government sets a cap on pollution
3. Green consumption = individual consumers choose goods or services based on their certified environmental impacts, typically paying more for more benign commodities
