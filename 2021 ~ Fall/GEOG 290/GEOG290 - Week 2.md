# GEOG290 - Week 2: The Anthropocene
- **"The two crises of the Anthropocene":** the great acceleration and the great divergence

# The Anthropocene
> Anthropocene ~ Geological epoch marking the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change

- **The Anthropocene is...**
    - A way of describing the current problem of environment and society
    - An attempt to bring many diverse problems together under a label
    - An attempt to bring people together to make a difference in relation to this collection of problems (like how the term environmentalism functions)
    - In other words, the Anthropocene is both a **description** and a **story** (see Nixon reading)
        - There are different ways to tell the story of the Anthropocene and how this story is told matters in what "solutions" get proposed and enacted

# The Great Acceleration
- 1950's = **"The great acceleration"**
    - Period of enormous growth, coinciding with the rise of **globalization and industrialization**; significant point in the increased human impact on the Earth's environments
    - "Hockey stick graph" phenomena found on many graphs where there is a long period of no growth (flat line) and then a short period of enormous growth that coincides with the great acceleration; found on any graphs that mark the growth of some metric over time that is affected by humans across decades (temperature, CO2, plastic production, energy use, etc.)

- The great acceleration is reflected in both...
    - **Socioeconomic trends:**
        - Population, GDP, foreign investments (marker of globalization), energy/water use, etc.
    - **Earth system trends:**
        - Greenhouse gas levels, surface temperature, ocean acidification, tropical forest loss, land degradation and biodiversity loss, etc.

- Most relavent to the great acceleration are the changes associate with the growing **climate crisis**
    - Ex: rising temperatures, biodiversity loss, forest coverage loss, rising carbon dioxide levels, etc.

# The Great Divergence
> "In 2013, the world's eighty-five richest people had a net worth equal to that of 50% of the world population"

- Also known as the **crisis of inequality**
- Describes the acceleration in wealth disparity between the richest and poorest of the world; "the great acceleration of **inequality**"

- Considerations of growing inequality is often left out of the discussion of the Anthropocene or great acceleration

- **The great divergence in Canada:**
    - "minimum wage and the average hourly wage have remained the same since the 1970's while Canada's GDP and wealth of the top 1% has exploded during this time"

# Neoliberalism
> "The great acceleration and great divergence both really took off with the onset of neoliberalism in the late 1970's"

- **Neoliberalism** = a political approach that favors free-market capitalism, deregulation, and reduction in government spending
    - insists that the market is perfectly efficient and most effective in enacting economic change compared to government policy
- **Free markets** = an economic system in which prices are determined by **unrestricted competition** between privately owned businesses

- Began with change in social policy headed by major capitalist nations
    - Election of Margaret Thatcher (UK, 1979) and Ronald Reagan (USA, 1980)
- End of the **welfare state** (the nanny state) and **Keynesianism**
- Roll back the state, roll out the market (limit regulation and leave economic change to the prosperity of the **market**)

- **Neoliberalism led too...**
    1. **Freeing the market:** massive privatization, cuts to government protections for citizens (welfare programs), deregulation of business
    2. Accelerated and intensified exploitation of working people and natural resources
    3. Booming economic growth (of which profits were allocated unequally and increasingly to the top 1%)
    4. Increased inequality and massive transfers of wealth from the working class communities (particularly communities of color) to the wealthiest

# Reading Notes: The Great Acceleration and the Great Divergence - Nixon
- "Approaching the question of vulnerability in the Anthropocene from the perspective of two of the greatest crises of our time: **the environmental crisis and the inequality crisis**"

- A big point the author is making is that stories matter, and shaping our understanding and perspective on our own unfolding story within the Anthropocene is crucial in leading us down the right path in the future in ways such as informing political policy on environmental and social issues

> "I would argue that the most influential Anthropocene intellectuals have sidestepped the question of unequal human agency, unequal human impacts, and unequal human vulnerabilities. If, by contrast, we take an environmental justice approach to Anthropocene storytelling, we can better acknowledge the way the geomorphic powers of human beings have involved unequal exposure to risk and unequal access to resources"

> "Most Anthropocene scholars date the new epoch to the late-eighteenth-century beginnings of industrialization. But there is a second phase to the Anthropocene, the so-called great acceleration, beginning circa 1950: an exponential increase in human-induced changes to the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle and in ocean acidification, global trade, and consumerism, as well as the rise of international forms of governance like the World Bank and the IMF"

- Author argues that not enough attention is payed to the relation between the Great Acceleration and the rise of **Neoliberalism**, of which is characterized by a widening chasm of inequality between the highest and lowest classes
    - "since the late 1970's, we have been living through what Timothy Noah calls 'the great divergence'"

- The authors problem with Neoliberalism is that 

> "In megacities, defensive architecture rises ever higher alongside indefensible inequities. All this injustice will be legible in the Anthropocene’s stratigraphic record for millennia to come."

# Reading Notes: "Neoliberalism" in Encyclopedia of Geography - Mullings
> "A set of philosophies and discourses emphasizing the importance of free markets to development and prosperity"

- **Neoliberalism** = a political approach that favors free-market capitalism, deregulation, and reduction in government spending
    - insists that the market is perfectly efficient and most effective in enacting economic change compared to government policy

- **Free markets** = an economic system in which prices are determined by **unrestricted competition** between privately owned businesses

## Development of Neoliberalism
- Influenced by the writing of the neo-classical economist **Friedrich Hayek** and later **Milton Friedman**
    - **Friedrich Hayek** saw free markets as vital to individual liberty because free markets ensured that individuals could not manipulate the resources of a given environment for their own advantage
    - **Milton Friedman** argued that economies were best stabilized through controls over the supply of money rather than through state fiscal intervention, which he argued tended to produce inflation. Like Hayek, Friedman viewed economic interventions by states as impediments to economic growth and individual liberty

### Neoliberalism in the Global North
- **Global North** = equated with developed countries; "first world countries"

- In the global North, Neoliberal philosophies were popularized alongside the Fordist system of production and consumption as well as the Keynesian welfare-oriented approach

> Between the 1940's and 1960's, Fordist industries became engines of economic growth because they achieved high levels of productivity through the use of technologies that allowed firms to maintain strict control over the production process. As a result, Fordist mass-produced goods were low in cost and affordable to large segments of most population. Fordist mass consumption, on  the other hand, was facilitated by states through policies that supported the family wage, job security, and welfare-oriented investments in areas such as health and education.

- By the mid 1970's, rising levels of unemployment and inflation signaled the end of Fordism and the Keynesian social contract. The crisis of the 1970's created the context for the revival of the ideas of Hayek and the policy prescriptions of Friedman, which heretofore had been largely ignored

### Neoliberalism in the Global South
- **Global South** = term used to identify lower-income countries on one side of the so-called global North–South divide; "third world countries"

- In the global South, Neoliberal discourses emerged in the wake of the 1974 oil price crisis and the rising levels of debt that followed increases in interest rates in the United States; Particularly among Latin American and Caribbean countries

> Under the leadership of General Augusto Pinochet, Chile became the first country where neoliberal policy prescriptions were systematically implemented.  Closely influenced by the views of Milton Friedman, whose former students became key architects in the neoliberal restructuring of Chile, these policies included the reduction of public welfare spending, the dismantling of regulations over entry and competition in markets, and the privatization of formerly nationally owned industries

- Shock therapy in Chile laid the foundations for a more systematic set of neoliberal strategies that became known as **structural adjustment programs (SAP's)**
    - SAPs aimed to reduce government fiscal imbalances and debt by opening up economies to the market through privatizations, devaluations, reductions in public social spending, and the lifting of trade restrictions and state controls over prices

## Changing Relationships Among States, Markets, and Civil Society
- "The importance of the United States in shaping the nature of Neoliberalism in the global South during the 1980's is a reflection of the **changing relationship between states, markets, and civil society** that had begun to be put into practice by Margaret  Thatcher, the then prime minister of the United Kingdom, and Ronald  Reagan, the then president of the United States"

- "The early policies introduced by Thatcher and Reagan revolved around the relaxation, and in many cases, removal of market regulations, such as fixed exchange rates; the reestablishment of private property rights, largely through the privatization of previously nationally owned industries; and the retreat of state from the provision of social welfare"

## Criticisms of Neoliberalism
- "**David Harvey argues** that the policies associated with Neoliberalism heighten patterns of uneven development because they promote forms of capital accumulation that enable the richest class groupings to accumulate surpluses by appropriating the assets and rights of others"
    - defines the type of capitalist growth associated with Neoliberalism as **“accumulation by dispossession”** to highlight the extent to which these policies have redistributed wealth from the poorest to the wealthiest of people and places

# Reading Notes: What the new UN report warning of climate impacts means for Canadians - Mortillario
- Article reporting on the warming of the climate and the effects it will have on our planet and lives

## Deep Changes in the Arctic
- The Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate than the rest of the world and polar regions have begun to experience extreme heat events at more than three times the global rate
- Permafrost has been thawing in the Arctic since the 1980's, releasing methane into the atmosphere and further contributing to global warming; positive feedback loop
- Then there's the ice. Arctic sea ice cover is at its lowest level since 1850, and the Arctic is projected to be practically ice-free at its summer minimum in roughly 30 years
- Melting snow and ice results in a positive feedback loop of warming as there is more sunlight to be absorbed by the newly exposed darker waters

## More Heat Events
- In northern North America, the UN report found that temperatures were projected to increase much faster compared to the global average, particularly in the winters
    - The higher the temperature becomes as a result of climate change, the more frequent heat waves and wildfires become

## A Toll on our Oceans and Water
- Sea levels are "certain to rise" throughout the 21st century and beyond due to the warming climate
    - This is both due to a warming ocean that expands, as well as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets that contribute to the ocean volume

- Rising sea levels have severe implications for coastal communities as the risk of floods increase and previously accessible coastal land becomes submerged under rising waters

- "In Ontario, parts of Quebec and the Atlantic region, it's very likely that there will be increases in the amount of rain as well as extreme precipitation. This means there is likely to be more flooding not only along our waterways, but also in places that normally don't flood"

## Hotter Cities
- Most people across the world live in cities and Canada is no different, but living in these dense spaces means that the effects of increasing heat waves are exacerbated; this is referred to as the **urban heat island effect**
    - Cities trap heat because tall buildings close in proximity prevent air circulation and absorb heat which is re-emitted at night

- Increasing urbanization has made temperature extremes in cities worse, particularly for nighttime extremes. In many cases, this means that air pollution worsens as surface ozone particles increase. This is exacerbated by rising fires and smoke
