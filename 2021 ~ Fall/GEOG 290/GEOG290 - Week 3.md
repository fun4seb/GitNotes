# GEOG290 - Week 3: Environmental Imaginaries & Justice
- **Organization of today's class:**
    - What is an imaginary? Why should we care?
    - What is an **environmental imaginary?**
        - Two examples: "plowshare" and "anointed"
    - What is **environmental justice?**
        - Traditional and critical environmental justice

# Environmental Imaginaries
- What do we mean by imaginary?
    - How we **imagine or understand the world**; basically one's worldview
- Why does it matter how we understand the world?
    - How we think about things affects how we act
    - Our understanding affects what we are able to see; the way we frame things in our imagination affects what sort of issues are visible to us
    - The imagination, of some people and organizations more than others, shapes the world in concrete ways

- What is imagination? (from Purdy reading)
    - "Imagination is how we see, and how we learn to see, how we suppose the world works, how we suppose that it matters, what we feel we have at stake in it… the bold speculations buried in our everyday lives"
    - "Imagination also enables us to do things together politically: a new way of seeing the world can be a way of valuing it; a map of things worth saving, or of a future worth creating"

- **Social construction** = idea that the world we experience comes to us through our ideas about it; we construct our own reality through our perceptions and ideas around it
    - Specifically, how we understand the world depends on (1) how we think and feel about it as individuals, and (2) the range of ways that the society in which we live understands the world
    - Idea that our imagination constructs the world we live in

- **Environmental imaginary** = ones unique vision of the environmental world
    - The material conditions of ones environment shapes their conception of what "environment" even means and this impacts how they choose to solve problems or perceive issues

- Different environmental imaginaries make sense of the environment in quite different ways
    - Some environmental imaginaries focus on a non-human natural world, others describe human-populated rural and forested environments, the urban environment, or even the whole world!
    - **The spatial and material conditions of an environment influence the environmental imaginaries that may emerge from it**; ones understanding of their environment will develop very differently depending on the space they occupy and the environment that shaped them
        - How you are situated affects the kind of imaginaries you can come up with
    - Not every environmental imaginary is equally valid and some are contradictory to others

- Environmental imaginaries are **created around perceived environmental problems:**
    - By stakeholders
    - By audience
    - Over time
    - Across space

## Plowshare: Studying Environmental Imaginaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpjFU_kBaBE

- **Big point:** Analyzing environmental imaginaries is one way we will make sense of the various proposals for changing environment and society that we encounter in this class

- **"Plowshare" Video Questions:**
    1. **What is the "environment" according to the individuals or group portraying it?**
        - A source of untapped potential for resources, a land to be harvested for gain or conquered
        - Idea that nature is hostile; something to overcome
    2. **According to them, what is the problem with the environment and who caused it?**
        - Inaccessible for exploitation, often barren and unwelcoming to human development; this problem must be solved by tightening our grasp on the environment
        - No existing logistical routes to access new material (uranium); must construct new logistical networks
    3. **According to them, how is the problem to be resolved?**
        - With operation "Plowshare"; explore and develop ways to use nuclear explosives in safe ways for land development and agriculture (Ex: clearing hills and rock blasting)
    4. **Again, according to this group, who has the authority for the environment? Who should make the decisions?**
        - The United States Atomic Energy Commission; The state
        - Skilled workers such as engineers and scientists are given authority to make decisions due to their specialized knowledge
    5. **Who is the intended audience for their proposal?**
        - "Mankind" (American people); this proposal is seeking the approval of the American people to exploit the environment through nuclear technology and normalize the power source for use in military settings, all for the "betterment of mankind"
    6. **Who will be included in this effort to solve the environmental problem and whom does it exclude?**
        - The American people are included in this effort and stand to benefit from the exploitation of the environment due to the fact that it will lead to infrastructure development (the creation of jobs and demand for trades) and positively impact the economy
        - Aboriginal peoples who depend on the health of the landscape and who are directly negatively impacted by its exploitation are excluded in this effort as their interests do not align with the stakeholders of operation Plowshare
        - Citizens of foreign countries who stand to be oppressed or threatened with nuclear weaponry (Japan, Russia)

## Environmental Imaginaries Summary
- The idea of “environmental imaginaries” is a useful conceptual tool to make sense of environmental campaign projects and how they conceptualize the environment
- Employing the idea of an “environmental imaginary” as we have done today helps us analyze environmental campaigns or projects
- Environmental imaginaries are diverse and contradictory
- Some environmental imaginaries reinforce each other, others are in conflict, just like the varied environmental solutions and movements we will study in this class
- This multiplicity of imaginaries represents a resource on which environmental movements build and through which we can express our ideas about the environment

# Environmental Justice
- **Environmental justice** = movement based on the notion that **everyone is entitled to the same levels of environmental and public health protection**; equal distribution of environmental responsibility and support for all peoples
    - Environmental justice as a field of research seeks to understand the processes and situations which lead to the violation of the above standard
    - This course uses environmental justice as a lens to make sense of all kinds of environmental campaigns and solutions and their efficacy

- An example of **environmental injustice** would be a situation where certain groups or regions are not receiving the same level of environmental and public health protection (Ex: People being exposed to pesticides, local industrial waste, or lack of clean drinking water)

## Pillars of Traditional & Critical Environmental Justice Approaches
- **Three pillars of traditional Environmental justice:**
    1. **Distribution:** environmental justice is achieved through a fair distribution of environmental "goods" and "bads" to everyone regardless of race, region, class, etc.
    2. **Participation** people and communities that are affected by environmental justice need to be involved in the solutions; environmental justice must be achieved through participatory efforts of all parties
    3. **Recognition:** there must be formal laws and structures that are recognized by government advocating for environmental justice and equality; formal recognition (under law) in the eyes of the state

- **Critical environmental justice goes beyond the traditional approach**, one way it does this is by **questioning the role and efficacy of the state** and how it relates to the previous pillars:**
    1. **The problem with distribution:** redistributing environmental "goods" or bads" does not change the political system or social relations that creates those distributions in the first place; band-aid solutions of redistribution cannot fix complex environmental or social issues
    2. **The problem with participation:** often those invited to participate are leaders of the larger organizations only, often men, and others are often excluded; biased form of participation
    3. **The problem with recognition and inclusion:** often recognition can happen through the law, but then (1) law is not enforced, (2) getting the law passed may exhaust the people involved in the campaign, (3) some who struggle for environmental justice may not want recognition or inclusion by the state (Ex: indigenous nations on their territories)

- **Four pillars of critical environmental justice:**
    1. **Focuses on multiple forms of inequality and their relations** with each other; **Intersectional** approach to oppression that recognizes links between racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, colonialism, speciesism, etc. and how these structures combine to oppress groups of people
        - Ex: Black women may experience increased oppression due to the **intersection** of racism and sexism
    2. Takes seriously the way that environmental injustice (and justice!) **takes places across and between scales** and not just in one community or neighborhood
    3. Questions **entrenched power relations** including state power
    4. Insists that **no one is expendable**; no group should be abandoned or sacrificed (Ex: because they don’t have citizenship, are in prison, where they live, their identity etc.) so that others (global North) may live comfortably

## Environmental Justice Atlas
https://ejatlas.org/

- **Premise/hypothesis of the environmental justice atlas:**
    - Capitalist economies require raw materials to continue to grow
    - As a result, the **frontiers of extraction** of these raw materials continue to expand; these frontiers are reaching increasingly sensitive, sacred, and protected areas
    - There is an unequal spatial distribution of the effects of this extraction, causing environmental justice protests/campaigns to emerge and intensify as a result
    
- **Why collect these campaigns together in the environmental justice atlas?**
    - Make struggles visible which are often invisible
    - Advance understanding at multiple scales and places
    - Encourage the environmental justice struggles
    - Help organizers to connect with each other, to learn from each other, and eventually to join there voice together

## Environmental Justice Summary
1. We have an approach for analyzing how environmental justice problems are understood and enacted called **environmental imaginaries**
    - What does the "environment" mean to these groups and how does that notion influence how they act and the solutions they create
2. **Environmental justice** is a field which helps us to make sense of the efficacy of proposed environmental campaigns
    - Environmental justice helps us analyze these campaigns and evaluate the outcome of proposed environmental projects
3. We have highlighted some risks associated this approach (see #2 above) as well some additional points that Pellow describes as the field of **critical environmental justice**
    - Critical environmental justice highlights the impact of the state on justice campaigns and how it can undermine the goal of environmental justice projects
