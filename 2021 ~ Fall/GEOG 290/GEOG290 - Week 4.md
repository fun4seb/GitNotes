# GEOG 290 - Week 4: Colonial Origins of "Environment and Society"
- **Elements of the term writing project:**
    1. Introduce the environmental problem
    2. In 3-5 sentences introduce **three approaches** being used to resolve the problem (Ex: via policy/regulation, via grassroots movement, via market incentives, or other means such as revolutionary change)
    3. To investigate this environmental problem, this essay will examine a particular case study...
        - a) **description:** background and objectives of the campaign? environmental imaginary? is the campaign based on western dualistic conception of the environment
        - b) **politics:** how do the actions and strategies of the campaign seem to be inspired by the environmental imaginary?
    4. Brief conclusion: why do you think this campaign matters or not? Why did you choose it? Are there particular ways that you are connected to this campaign personally, emotionally, professionally, or in other ways?
    5. References: 1 reference that defines environmental imaginary and 3 related to solutions to your environmental problem. Others as needed but not required

- **Organization of today's class:**
    - **Theory:** How is "environment" related to "society" when we speak of "environment and society"?
    - **History (antecedents):** What came before "environment and society"? Where did "environment and society" come from? How did it spread?
    - **Alternatives:** is "environment and society" the only way to understand the world?

# Theory: What is the idea of "Environment and Society"?
- Idea of environment and society as entrenched and **separate** from one another
    - Notion of the environment as separate from people; "environment" being associate with green trees and plants (Ex: Google stock images of "environment") while people/society always being represented as hands (in the case of stock photos) that are meant to "nurture" the environment from the outside
    
- This idea of "environment" and "society" as separate domains emerged out of **anti-colonialist thought**
    - Anti-colonialists **Frantz Fanon** and **Val Plumpwood** explain that the dualistic western conception of nature ("environment" AND "society") contains an inherent (baked in) system of inequality in which **"society" has power over the "environment" and that the two are defined in relation to each other**
    - Deconstructing colonial reason/habits of thought revealed a **pattern** (prevalence of dualisms)
        - **The pattern** = the prevalence of **dualisms** (binaries) in which one element was imagined to be **superior** over the other and the elements were **defined in relation to each other** (Ex: mind/body, west/east, global North/South, civilized/primitive, man/woman)
        - **"Environment and society" is just another dualism** because it attributes society (people) as superior and powerful while the environment is considered subordinate and is at the mercy/dependent on society; power dynamic introduced when conceptualizing the world in terms of dualisms
        - These dualisms are the building blocks of racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, etc. stereotypes that structure western society

- **Takeaway from anti-colonialist perspective** = The concept of "environment and society" conceals a hierarchical relation (in the form of a dualism/binary)between society (superior) on one hand, and environment (inferior) on the other

# History: What came before?
- Why focus on how previous people viewed their environment?
    - To understand that there is more than one way to view the world, and that the way we view the world has changed over time

- Medieval European environmental imaginaries:
    - **Pre-16th century Europe: how are pre-enlightenment/medieval peasants imagining their relation to the environment?** (Merchant Chapter 2: 41-46)
        - They think of the Earth as a sort of mother/caretaker; spiritual relationship with the Earth
        - **Reciprocal relationship** between people and environment; when taking from the Earth you must also make an offering/sacrifice to keep balance
        - Environment and society are **entangled together**, rather than separate; **organic view of nature**
    - **Judaeo-Christian biblical view of the environment**
        - There is a **"god given" divine order** that places humans as being closest to god and the rest of nature being below humans 
        - Emphasizes **dominion** over the environment; established order
        - Sense of people being distinct from plants and animals because humans are made "in the image of god"; humans as superior over nature
        - Establishes a **hierarchy/order** where humans (society) are meant to dominate and subdue nature (environment); it is not strictly a distinction, there is a power dynamic between environment and society

- **How did the western idea of separate environment and society become so widespread?**
    - Transition from subsistence to capitalist economies
        - Land that would previously be used to survive started to be enclosed and privatized by the capitalist elites, forcing peasants to start working in society to survive as nature became more inaccessible; **humans become disconnected from nature through capitalism**
        - New incentives for exploitation; **commoditization of nature**
        - New visions of environment emerged including the notion of environment and society as separate; environment as something to be conquered and plundered
        - Merchant argues that as capitalism became the dominant economic form via colonialism/imperialism the organic view of nature began to dissolve and a new worldview emerged that would be more consistent with capitalist activities, declaring **nature as subordinate to people/society**; as capitalist relations spread, so did this understanding of the world
    - Rise of experimental science
        - Nature as something to be exploited and dissected to produce **knowledge**; further emphasizes a separation between environment and society

# Contemporary Alternatives
- Contemporary indigenous knowledge of the world
    - The land is indivisible from ones culture
    - Reciprocal relationship with nature

# Origins of "Environment and Society" Summary
- The idea of environment and society as **separate** is a specific expression of the western conception of nature, however **this view is not universal** and we know that because:
    - We can describe it with a theory
    - We can describe what came before it (antecedents)
    - We can document alternatives to it (it is not the only way of conceptualizing the world)
    - We can trace geographies and histories of this concept
