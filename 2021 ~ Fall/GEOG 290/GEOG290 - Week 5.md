# GEOG290 - Week 5: Transition to Capitalism in Europe
- **How did the western conception of nature spread?**
    1. The violent "transition" to capitalism in Europe
    2. The changing meaning of environment (commons) and gender (role of men and women) in the transition
    3. The role of the state in solidifying the changes that occurred during the transition

# Transition to Capitalism
- Elites had difficulty controlling the peasants under feudalism
- Capitalism offered new opportunities for elites to **accumulate wealth**, however it could not be installed without resistance from peasants and especially peasant women because capitalism required a change in thought and establishment of new forms of control

- **Challenges of peasant life during feudalism:**
    - People who lived by farming the land in Europe (peasants) tried to create new societies and ways of living in the 11th and 12th centuries
    - They critiqued the corruption of the church, social hierarchy, and economic exploitation of feudalism
    - With access to land, they sought to create autonomous and egalitarian communities

- Strategies of the elite to gather wealth **(primitive accumulation)**:
    - Enclosure movement (taking the commons on which peasants relied and privatizing them)
    - Brutal punishment for stealing
    - Wars against internal enemies (autonomous communities of peasants) that helped to discipline the labor force
    - Taking over church land
    - The African slave trade and the colonial plantations
    - Taking land for agriculture and mining gold and silver in the Americas
