# GEOG290 - Week 5: Transition to Capitalism in Europe
- **How did the western conception of nature spread?**
    1. The violent "transition" to capitalism in Europe
    2. The changing meaning of environment (commons) and gender (role of men and women) in the transition
    3. The role of the state in solidifying the changes that occurred during the transition

# Transition to Capitalism
- Elites had difficulty controlling the peasants under feudalism
- Capitalism offered new opportunities for elites to **accumulate wealth**, however it could not be installed without resistance from peasants and especially peasant women because capitalism required a change in thought and establishment of new forms of control

- **Challenges of peasant life during feudalism:**
    - People who lived by farming the land in Europe (peasants) tried to create new societies and ways of living in the 11th and 12th centuries
    - They critiqued the corruption of the church, social hierarchy, and economic exploitation of feudalism
    - With access to land, they sought to create autonomous and egalitarian communities

- Strategies of the elite to gather wealth **(primitive accumulation)**:
    - Enclosure movement (taking the commons on which peasants relied and privatizing them)
    - Brutal punishment for stealing
    - Wars against internal enemies (autonomous communities of peasants) that helped to discipline the labor force
    - Taking over church land
    - The African slave trade and the colonial plantations
    - Taking land for agriculture and mining gold and silver in the Americas
    
- **The "crisis" of feudalism** (from the perspective of the elites)
    - Crisis because the elites were not able to extract as much resources from the peasants as before due to rebellion and black death decreasing the number of workers

- The transition to capitalism resulted in the **fall of real wages (buying power) for working people**, as well as the simultaneous **rise in real food prices**; cost of living is increasing while wages are declining, i.e. the people are be extracted for all they have
    - This was due to elites preventing workers from organizing/unionizing, and merchants being free to speculate food prices and prince gouge 
    - Marks a **decline in quality of life for the average person**
    - The rise of real food prices can be correlated with an increase in indictments for food theft, as well as a temporary decline in population (due to hunger) during the transition to capitalism
    
- The transition to capitalism resulted in a shift in the dominant understanding of nature; the western understanding of **environment as separate and subordinate to society** becomes the dominant view

## Gender & Capitalism
- **Gendered violence** toward women during the transition to capitalism:
    - As capitalism and western science emerged (1505-1650), women were targeted as "witches" and subject to violence
        - Witch hunts spread to the colonies
    - **Why were peasant women targeted by capitalism?**
        - Rural peasant women had a privileged position in the world of organic nature because they **embodied and knew the commons**
        - Because women embodied the common spaces that peasants depended on for resources, they **fiercely opposed the enclosure movement**
        - They knowledge of the commons extended to medicines that grew in common lands
        - Midwives and others who were knowledgeable about reproduction were seen as a threat to authorities and by the new institutions of science

- **The labor status of women changed as the working class was made**; change in the distribution of labor forced women into the home while men occupy the public space
    - Men received the work that was previously done by the women within the commons (that they had now lost), and women were now expected to do unpaid work within the household to support men making low wages
        - Real wages were able to decline during the transition to capitalism primarily because **women were now performing unpaid labor to support men**
    - Women were forced into dependence on men because they were now expected to work inside the home
    - Huge increase in the number of sex workers
    - Creation of **nature enclosures** that reinforced the separation between environment and society

- How were these new arrangements enforced?
    - Context of the **birth of the modern state**; as the state increased its ability to target individuals in society through taxation, conscription, and policing, it facilitated capitalist relationships, the creation of the labor force, and the subjugation of women
    - **administrative authority over the behavior of the people is strengthened during the transition to capitalism**, allowing the state to enforce economic change more radically

- **In sum, new environmental imaginaries that understood humans as separate from environment "naturalized" inequality in Europe:**
    - Enclosures lead to a loss of access to the commons including the medicinal plants and spiritual spaces found there
    - New "natural" gender roles in which women had almost no access to employment and depended on husbands and male family members for survival
    - For working class and peasant men, the new system offered a bargain: the loss of access to commons was "replaced" by the support of women doing unpaid labor in the home
    - The new gender hierarchies and land ownership patterns were enforced by violence, including gender-based violence (Ex: witch trials)
