# GEOG290 - Week 6: Locke's Theory on Property and the Transition to Capitalism in the Americas
- **Topic of today's class:**
    - Exploring Locke's essay on the idea of **property** and how it is related to capitalism in the Americas

# Locke's Essay on the Nature of Property
- Locke's essay invited his readers to imagine the world in a new way, including the environment
- Locke's **Eurocentric** environmental imaginary sought to justify the unjustifiable: the **theft of land from indigenous people and the enslavement of Africans**
- Lock was not just a philosopher, he was also invested in colonization and the slave trade

## Locke's Argument
- **What is Locke arguing?**
    - "God gave the world to Adam and his posterity in common"; All the land and resources of the Earth are given to us by god and to be shared equally
    - **Contradiction that must be solved by Locke:** if the Earth is given to all of us equally how can anyone "own" private property without the permission of everyone?
        - Locke is arguing that even though god gave us everything in the commons equally, it is still possible to have private property/ownership of resources without everyone's permission by acting in accordance with the **"word of God"** (consistent with what God would want); this is to frame the creation of property as an **ethically acceptable** practice acting in accordance with religion

- Why does Lock need to reference **religion** when arguing for the creation of property?
    - At the time of writing religion was the dominant way in which people understood the world, therefor views/practices that are supported by religion have more authority

- **Locke's objective** = show that even though god gave humanity everything equally, it is **ethical and logical that people (specifically Europeans) should own private property without asking everyone's permission** (Ex: indigenous peoples)
    - Locke argues that these practices are ethical by saying that god must have intended for man to make use of the land to the best of his ability and to have a **means to appropriate the abundance given to man in the commons**
        - How then is man supposed to make use of the abundance given to him to the best of his ability? Locke is arguing this is to be done through the **making of property**

## Creation of Property
- "Man has property in himself and on this basis can make property"
    - Man owns his own labor, and this labor can **create property by combining with nature**
    - Parallel with Capitalism: our value is in the labor we can provide and export

- **Nature + labor = property**
    - By combining one's labor with the common land (nature), property is created
    - Example of **hunting** deer, **collecting** acorns/water; once you have combined your own labor with the resources of nature those resources must become yours (property), because if they are not yours when you collect a resource they might as well never be yours
        - Locke is using the examples of dear and acorns to lead into the real topic of this essay which is to **justify the ownership of private land**

- How is property in **land** created specifically?
    - Nature + **reasoned labor** = property in land; root of the **racism** in Locke's definition
        - **Reasoned labor refers to Eurocentric forms of labor (land cultivation)** and subtly implies that Europeans specifically are the ones who should improve and take ownership over the land; excludes indigenous/African peoples from being able to create property as their labor is not "logical"
        - The requirement of using **reason** excludes the unprivileged and colonized from being able to take ownership of the land because by Locke's definition those who organized/directed the improvement of land (those with power) should received ownership rather than the peasant who actually worked the land (or the indigenous person who is not improving the land in a European way)

- In Locke's view, common land that is unimproved by human labor is **waste**, as there is potential benefit to be gained that is not being harvested; land must be privatized and enclosed in order to produce

## Property in Practice: Locke's Business
- Locke's ideas on property are directly related to his career as a colonial administrator for the **American Carolina colonies**
    - Locke oversaw the circulation of goods between Europe and America and this generated mass amounts of wealth for many Europeans invested in Atlantic trade

- Locke was heavily invested in the Royal African Company
    - Royal African Company charter of 1672 allowed the company to trade **slaves**

- **How do Locke's business practices relate to his theory on property?**
    - Locke is directly benefiting from the justification of amassing property and wealth at the expense of peasant labor, indigenous land rights, and African lives; **Locke is justifying the appropriation of land "for the good of all"**
    - Locke's essay is a rationalization for the emerging capitalist practices he is observing and participating in

## Locke's Theory of Property Summary
- Locke argues that **God wanted the commons to be turned into private property**
- Locke's theory of property was used to **displace indigenous people** who he and other Europeans viewed as still in a **state of nature/primitive (incapable of rational work)
- In practice, Locke's theory of nature and labor increased the demand for enslaved Africans since colonial authorities **allocated land according to the number of settlers including slaves**

- Locke's theory is another example of environment (nature) and society (labor) being distinguished and

## Locke's Impact on the Present
- Is Locke's essay **responsible** for the dispossession of indigenous people in the Americas?
    - **NO!** (essays don't have that power) But it did work to **justify** the colonial dispossession of indigenous peoples and did influence future capitalist theory (That Locke was participating in!)

- Today in Canada only 0.2 % of the total land area of Canada is under indigenous control; **nearly all of the land once held by indigenous populations has been appropriated**
