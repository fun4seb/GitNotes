# GEOG290 - Week 9: Consumption

# Reading Notes: Individualization: Plant a Tree, Buy a Bike, Save the World? - Maniates
- **Individualization of responsibility**
    - "When responsibility for environmental problems is individualized, there is little room to ponder institutions, the nature and exercise of political power, or ways of collectively changing the distributions of power and influence in society-- to, in other words, 'think institutionally'" (Maniates, pg. 270)
    - "In our struggle to bridge the gap between our morals and our practices, we stay busy-- but busy doing that with which we're most familiar and comfortable: consuming our way (we hope) to a better America and a better world" (Maniates, pg. 273)
    - Rise of global environmental problems and the construction of an individualized politics around them; "Buy energy efficient appliances! Carpool to work! Don't use straws! Plant a tree!"
        - The responsibility of solving environmental problems thus falls to individuals who have little power to enact institutional change that are driving most environmental issues
        - The level of solutions is not consistent with the scale of the problem
    - "...commerce and sustainability were antithetical by design, not by intention" (quote by Paul Hawken in Maniates, pg. 275)
