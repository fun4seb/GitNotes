# GEOG310 - Week 1: Historical Context

# Reading Notes: We Refugees - Arendt
 - Hannah Arendt is considered one of the most important political thinkers of the 20th century
    - Experienced and wrote about being **stateless** throughout the holocaust

- Reading is from the perspective of a Jew that is seeing the changes to the Jewish identity following the holocaust and mass exodus of Jewish refugees (diaspora), using terms like "we" to speak on behalf of the Jewish community and detail; describes how Jews cover their old identity and mold their new identity in a way to assimilate themselves into being "not Jewish", as to be Jewish is to be a refugee

- Who is a refugee?
    - "A refugee used to be a person driven to seek refuge because of some act committed or some political opinion held. Well, it is true we have had to seek refuge; but we committed no acts and most of us never dreamt of having any radical opinion"

- Label of "refugee"
    - Rejection of refugee status and what the label brings; being an immigrant/newcomer vs. a political refugee

- Rapid loss/change of identity (loss of language, culture, elders, etc.); creation of a **"new" Jewish identity**
    - Readiness to assimilate and forget their old identity as foreign nationals (Ex: Mr. Cohn story, always becoming a new patriot while never acknowledging the Jewish identity he is constantly rewriting)
    - Distancing oneself from anything that relates to being Jews as being Jewish is synonymous with being a refugee (appearing English-speaking rather than German, do not refer to oneself as stateless, etc.)
    - Assimilation into the new patriotic identity above all else; the seriousness to which Jews took on the prospect of assimilation into a new society cannot be understated; "We have been good Germans in Germany and therefore will be good Frenchmen in France"

- Division of a once whole community

- Realization that despite a generational practice of covering and rewriting an older Jewish identity, the entire diaspora has remained uniquely "Jewish" in their worldview and way of life

- **Arendt's conclusion:** Refugees driven from country to country represent the vanguard of their peoples
    - Each refugee becomes a symbol/spokesperson for their community and people

- How does she characterize death?
    - She re-frames life as worse than death within the Jewish experience of the time, people wish death because it means a release from the pain of life/persecution

# Assimilation vs Integration
- **Integration**
    - Two-way
    - Free to retain ethnic identity or assimilate or mix and match
    - National identity accommodates difference (Ex: through anti-discrimination policies)
    - Requires change of attitudes as well as institutions
    - **The society must be changed**

- **Assimilation**
    - One-way
    - Immigrants must fit into the host society, adopt dominant norms, becomes like their new compatriots
    - Seeks to erase difference
    - Goal is a homogeneous national identity
    - **The individual must be changed**
