# GEOG310 - Week 1: Historical Context

# Reading Notes: We Refugees - Arendt
- Reading is from the perspective of a Jew that is seeing the changes to the Jewish identity following the holocaust and mass exodus of Jewish refugees (diaspora), using terms like "we" to speak on behalf of the Jewish community and detail; describes how Jews cover their old identity and mold their new identity in a way to assimilate themselves into being "not Jewish", as to be Jewish is to be a refugee

- **Label of "refugee"**
    - Rejection of refugee status and what the label brings; being an immigrant/newcomer vs. a political refugee
    - Rapid loss/change of identity (loss of language, culture, elders, etc.); creation of a **"new" Jewish identity**
        - Readiness to assimilate and forget their old identity as foreign nationals (Ex: Mr. Cohn story, always becoming a new patriot while never acknowledging the Jewish identity he is constantly rewriting)
        - Distancing oneself from anything that relates to being Jews as being Jewish is synonymous with being a refugee (appearing English-speaking rather than German, do not refer to oneself as stateless, etc.)
        - Assimilation into the new patriotic identity above all else; the seriousness to which Jews took on the prospect of assimilation into a new society cannot be understated; "We have been good Germans in Germany and therefore will be good Frenchmen in France"
    - Division of a once whole community
    - Realization that despite a generational practice of covering and rewriting an older Jewish identity, the entire diaspora has remained uniquely "Jewish" in their worldview and way of life
