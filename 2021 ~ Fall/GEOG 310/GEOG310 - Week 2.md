# Reading Notes: Who is a Refugee? - Shacknove
- There are varying definitions of "refugee" from different sources and institutions however most states refer to the UN convention definition
- According to the UN convention a refugee is someone who **"owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"**
    - This definition is predicated on the argument that:
        1. A bond of trust, loyalty, protection, and assistance between the citizen and the state constitutes the normal basis for society
        2. In the case of the refugee, this bond has been severed
        3. Persecution and alienage are always the physical manifestations of this severed bond
        4. These manifestations are necessary and sufficient conditions for determining refugee status

- The Organization of African Unity (OAU) notably differs from the UN definition in that in addition to the UN's persecution based definition, the term refugee should also apply to **"every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of nationality"**
    - The variance in the definition between the OAU and UN reflect the historical context of both organizations
        - The UN's definition is in response to the Nazis when refugees were indeed persecuted victim of highly organized states
        - The OAU's definition recognizes what the UN does not which is that the bond between citizen and state can be severed in more diverse ways than just persecution; Ex: the chaotic breakdown of society (from war, famine, disaster, etc.) creates many refugees without overt persecution being aimed at them by a state

> "An overly narrow conception of "refugee" will contribute to the denial of international protection to countless people in dire circumstances whose claim to assistance is impeccable"

- The author is arguing that neither persecution nor alienage effectively capture what is essential about being a refugee; persecution is only one manifestation of a broader phenomenon, **the absence of state protection of the citizen's basic needs**

- Minimal social bond =
