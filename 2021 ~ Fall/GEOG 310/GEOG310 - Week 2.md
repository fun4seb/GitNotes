# GEOG310 - Week 2: Who is a Refugee? & Borders

# Lecture Notes: State and Refugees
- **Questions discussed in this lecture:**
    - Who is a refugee conceptually?
    - Who is a refugee as defined by the state
    - What are the (moral) obligations towards refugees?

- **Migrant** = someone who moves to another country, either temporarily or to permanently resettle

## Who is a Refugee?
- Common definition = a refugee is a person fleeing life threatening conditions
- Legal definition = a refugee is a person who has crossed a border due to fear of **persecution**
    - "Persecution" is key to the legal (state) definition and is the root of its problem as there are more threats than just persecution that could cause someone (or entire populations) to flee their country for fear of harm

### Nation-State

# Reading Notes: Who is a Refugee? - Shacknove
- There are varying definitions of "refugee" from different sources and institutions however most states refer to the UN convention definition
- According to the UN convention a refugee is someone who **"owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"**
    - This definition is predicated on the argument that:
        1. A bond of trust, loyalty, protection, and assistance between the citizen and the state constitutes the normal basis for society
        2. In the case of the refugee, this bond has been severed
        3. Persecution and alienage are always the physical manifestations of this severed bond
        4. These manifestations are necessary and sufficient conditions for determining refugee status

- The Organization of African Unity (OAU) notably differs from the UN definition in that in addition to the UN's persecution based definition, the term refugee should also apply to **"every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of nationality"**
    - The variance in the definition between the OAU and UN reflect the historical context of both organizations
        - The UN's definition is in response to the Nazis when refugees were indeed persecuted victim of highly organized states
        - The OAU's definition recognizes what the UN does not which is that the bond between citizen and state can be severed in more diverse ways than just persecution; Ex: the chaotic breakdown of society (from war, famine, disaster, etc.) creates many refugees without overt persecution being aimed at them by a state

> "An overly narrow conception of "refugee" will contribute to the denial of international protection to countless people in dire circumstances whose claim to assistance is impeccable"

- The author is arguing that neither persecution nor alienage effectively capture what is essential about being a refugee; persecution is only one manifestation of a broader phenomenon, **the absence of state protection of the citizen's basic needs**

# Lecture Notes: Borders and Movement
- Agenda:
    - The border
    - Refugee definition
    - Canada's refugee policies

## The Border
- "Borders represent a bounded way of thinking about land"
    - The border demarcates the nation-state, as well as the boundary between nation-states
    - Borders are ways of organizing land and **people**; the border is an indication of who "belongs" in the state (and who doesn't)
    - The border serves to help the sovereign power control the state through "gatekeeping" the land as well as the people and goods who may come and go

### Colonial Borders
- Borders were extremely important during colonial times as colonial powers extended their control of territory overseas, and legitimized this control through **cartographic maps**
    - Brought many borders together under the umbrella of larger political powers

### Present Day Border Walls
- Border walls are an **expression of power** (Ex: US border wall keeping out Mexico)
- We are now dependent on technology to facilitate control over border walls (sensors, drones, satellite imaging)

- Irony than an ancient form of controlling the movement of people and goods (walls) is still in use today

- What do borders mean for refugees?
    - A border is a **territorial line**; the end of one country, and the beginning of another
    - A border is where you might be subject to patrols, inspected, asked for proof, credibility determined (Ex: asked for a passport or identity papers)

## UNHCR
- A global human rights and advocacy organization (non-political agency)\
- The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has the responsibility of trying to **influence states to protect and find solutions for refugees without challenging their sovereignty**
- Offers emergency help (food, water, shelter)
- Monitors compliance with the 1951 convention, 1967 protocols
- Role is essentially to protect refugees from state persecution

## How is a Refugee Defined?

## How can a Refugee or Asylum Seeker enter Canada?
1. At the border: by making a claim to the border officer
2. Inside the country: making a claim at Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship office
    - Claims processed by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB)
3. From abroad: refereed by UNHCR to Canada for resettlement or privately sponsored by a group of citizens

# Reading Notes: Violent Borders: Refugees and the Right to Move - Jones
- Outlines the dangers and violence experienced by refugees who attempt to cross borders (Example in the intro of boys clinging to the underside of a bus to get into Europe)

- "This book disputes the idea that borders are a natural part of the human world and that migration is driven primarily by traffickers and smugglers. Instead **the existence of the border itself produces the violence that surrounds it**"
    - "The border creates the economic and jurisdictional discontinuities that have come to be seen as it hallmarks, providing an impetus for the movement of people, goods, drugs, weapons, and money across it"; **the hardening of the border through new security practices is the source of the violence not a response to it**

## The Global Migration Crisis
- "The years 2014 and 2015 were characterized by growing awareness of the plight of migrants worldwide"; time of unprecedented global migration
    - The UN found that 14 million people were displaced by war in 2014, the largest number since WW2, and 59.5 million displaced people globally

- "Powerful idea in the media and wealthy societies that violence at borders is inevitable when less developed, orderly countries rub against the rich, developed states of the world"
    - Paints a violent picture of less developed countries and harbors conflict between rich and poor countries as the rich "must keep the poor out", leads to militarization between borders; reflected in Trumps description of migrants, TV shows like "Border Wars, etc."

## States and Movement
- "Far from being a new feature of the globalizing world, the movement of people has been a threat to states since the earliest ones began to collect resources in towns and cities"
    - Ex: The creation of the Great Wall of China to keep out Mongols, "Hadrian's Wall" in ancient Rome to separate the tribes of northern Britannia

- Historically movement restrictions were not always done overtly with walls
    - Ex: 16th century England where hedges were used to restrict access to pastures and forests from peasants as the land became profitable in the emerging capitalist economy

- **Treaties of Westphalia**
    - After the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which resulted in the death of a quarter of Europe, the treaties of Westphalia introduced the idea of using territorial sovereignty, drawn on maps, to establish who has the right to make decisions in a particular places
    - As the sovereign states of Westphalia became more established in the 20th century, the movement of the poor from one state to another led to a new system of passports and visas to establish identity/citizenship and thereby restrict movement

- Extension of nautical borders by the UN restricted previously free movement in most of the world's accessible oceans

- When passive expressions of power such as walls, borders, or laws fail, physical violence is often the only means left to prevent undesired movement of peoples
    - While some migrants are killed by border agents, most deaths at borders occur because of new enforcement technologies (drones, sensors, walls, etc.) make the border crossing much more difficult and dangerous

## The Violence of Borders
- In addition to the direct forms of violence done to migrants at borders, there are also more subtle **systemic** forms of violence; direct vs. systemic violence against migrants
