# GEOG310 - Week 3: Humanitarianism in Canada

# Lecture Notes: History of Humanitarianism in Canada
- **Nation** = a large group of people said to be bound together by a shared history, culture, language, religion, and/or homeland
    - Shared affinity and national culture

- Outdated idea that certain races belonged in certain parts of the world (Ex: "white" in temperate zones, "yellow" in tropics, etc.) and that races of difference zones cannot acclimatize to other zones
    - Canada subscribed to this idea up until the 1920's
    - Justification for disallowing certain peoples to enter countries and informed immigration policy

- **Huguenots** = French protestants fleeing France to other parts of the world
    - Highly valued as refugees as they brought valuable skills with them from France and were "similar" to other nations allowing for easy assimilation
    - Example of refugees that were only accepted due to their ease of assimilation and similar in culture and looks to Canadians

## Major Historical Trends Impacting Canadian Immigration Policy Over Time
- Shift in the economic base from an agricultural to post-industrial foundation
- Demographic and cognitive shift from a "white-settler colony" to a "color-blind society"

- **White-settler nation** = traditional colonialist/imperialist "white-settler" nations (Canada, Australia, USA, UK, etc.)

- Major concern from 16th to first half of 20th century: immigration should not change the basic character of the Canadian population
- Manipulation of entry criteria (empire loyalty, climactic suitability, social ills) to create barriers on the basis of **race** to ensure a homogeneous population

- important to note that the first North American settlers were refugees, who also produced refugees
    - Religious extremists fleeing persecution (Ex: pilgrims)
    - Loyalist refugees (fleeing American revolution)

- Discrimination against minorities, migrants, and refugees was done not through overt violence but through selective policy
    - Ex: Chinese head tax to restrict immigration after Chinese migrants were no longer needed to build railways

### 20th Century
- 1930's: closed to newcomers except those from Britain and the US (selectively those of European descent; racist)
- 1940's: large influx of displaced persons from Europe, establishment of clear ethnic and economic goals for immigration policy
- 1952: new immigration act allows refusal of admission on the grounds of nationality, ethnic group, geographical area of origin, peculiar customs, habits and modes of life, unsuitability with regard to climate, probable inability to become assimilated
- 1962: Canada abandoned its preference for White immigrants
    - Admission to be based on individual personal characteristics; not nationality
1967: point system created to facilitate and encourage the flow of skilled migrants
Additional immigration posts were opened in the global south; resulting in a shift in typical region of immigrant origin

- These changes in policy resulted in a change in the demographics of Canadian society and lead to Canada being considered a **multicultural** nation
    - **Multiculturalism understood as...**
        - Empirical fact/lived realities:
        - An ideology:
        - A theory: sociological theories of difference and integration
        - Government policy and programs:
        - A practice

## Tibetan Refugee Pilot Project
- In order to test the ramifications of an influx of displaced people into Canadian society and their ability to assimilate to a new community, Pierre Trudeau allowed a small amount of young Tibetan families (so they would assimilate easier) to enter Canada 

## Private Sponsorship
- Following the Vietnam War, Canada allowed a group of 5 or more to sponsors the migration of refugees; this resulted in 30,000 refugees being taken in

# Reading Notes: Refugee Movements from the Global South and the Transformation of Canada's Immigration Framework - Madokoro
- This chapter examines how Canada's immigration programs evolved in the 1970's by tracing two strands of policies that emerged to deal with the movement of refugees globally:
    1. Canada's signing of the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees in 1969 as well as the introduction of refugee determination processes to consider the situation of individuals claiming refugee status in Canada
    2. Canada's use of discrete resettlement schemes to assist refugees caught up in various kinds of political turmoil in the Global South

- International laws and policies designed to help refugees following the post-war period deliberately used a very narrow definition of "refugee" to limit responsibility on the part of the international community
    - The UN definition outlined "persecution" as the main determiner of refugee status, thus ignoring the multitude of other ways a person can be displaced and limiting the scope of relevancy to those directly persecuted by the Nazis
    - Refugee policy was clearly designed as a reactive response to the situation in Europe rather than to help all people displaced by conflict globally

# Lecture Notes: Critique of Humanitarianism in Canada
- Declaration of Human Rights:
    - Article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person
    - Article 5: No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
    - Article 14: **Everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution**

## Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951
- **Defines what is a refugee**
- Rights
- Obligations
- Commitment of States

- **Principle of non-refoulement:** "No contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion"
    - You cannot return a refugee to its home-nation where they will experience punishment for seeking international support

## Boats in relation to Refugees
- Boats as a **symbol** of resistance for refugees; the vessel in which they seek freedom and risk their lives in the process
    - Boats as a symbol associated with **invasion**
    - Distinctly irregular form of travel; a refugee arriving to a country by boat sends a different message than arriving by plane
    - Ex: St. Louis, Komagata Maru, "Summer of Boats"

- Why do boats arriving on shores cause such controversy/panic?
    - Security issue
    - **Challenges the sovereignty** of the nation; refugees disregard any border rules and simply take their freedom into their own hands by arriving onshore

- **The geography of Canada in relation to the transport of refugees:**
    - Due to Canada's location (relatively inaccessible to most nations, other than by boat or air), and refugees must arrive on the west or east coast
    - In modern times arriving to Canada by boat is an **unusual occurrence** and brings forth societal feelings of apprehension; people(s) arriving unexpectedly by boat at a country's border is cause for alarm

- **Continuous Journey Regulation (1908)**
    - Rule stating that all migrants must arrive on a continuous, uninterrupted journey from their country of origin to Canada; **subtle way of excluding distant nation (such as Asian countries) from seeking help in Canada**
    - Succeeded in limiting south and east Asians from reaching Canada
    - **Komagata Maru** (Indian ship holding South Asian migrants) **challenged the sovereignty of Canada** by disregarding this policy and chartering a ship anyways, resulting in them being sent back and punished by Britain

## "Summer of Boats"
- The "Summer of Boats", refers to an event where hundreds of Chinese migrants seeking refugee status arrived on Canadian shores however only **5%** were accepted, mainly **women and children**

- Why were women and children disproportionately accepted as refugees compared to men?
        - Idea that women and children are the "ultimate" refugee that embodies victim-hood, while men are seen as threats/criminals and not deserving of help or pit; to be a man in need of support, or a confident and determined woman, is to defy the gendered roles of what a refugee should look like
        - Examination of the successful claims reveals that the men who were successful were those who drew on narratives of masculine heroism and claimed refugee status due to religious persecution while the women who made similar claims based in religious were unsuccessful (because women who show confidence are not in accordance with the normative refugee image)
        - There was a "script" to follow to prove your refugeeness, i.e. act like a helpless victim if woman, or a "heroic" man seeking shelter from religious/political persecution

- Conflation of migrant women on boats with women being trafficked/sex-trade

## Orientalism
- **Orientalism** = mode of thought that distinguishes between the "Orient" (far east) and "Occident" (the west)

- Orientalism is responsible with turning Asians in **"generalized others"**; us vs. them
    - Enforces stereotype of the typical weak, shy, quiet Asian woman with no agency

# Reading Notes: Women, Unaccompanied Minors, and Discourses of Criminalized Victimhood - Park
- Explores Canadian refugee policy regarding uninvited migrants through the context of the "summer of boats" (event in the summer of 1999 where 600 Chinese migrants from Fujian province arrived off the coast of British Columbia in four separate boats, however 95% of them were denied access, largely only women and children were accepted and the rest were deported) 

- Colonial relationship between first-world "saviors" and third-world victims/criminals

> "This chapter works from the premise that the Canadian refugee determination system is not an objective system that can distinguish true refugees from economic migrants using impartial, internationally recognized criteria regarding persecution. Rather, it is part of the global management of populations that draws on and reproduces colonial narratives of Asian women and children as pitiable victims of Asian men and culture"

- Author outlines how gender and age inform perceptions of victim-hood and criminality (men are viewed as foreign criminals abusing Canadian generosity, while women/children are viewed as victims of oppression deserving of pity)

## Gender and Age in the Refugee Protection and Anti-Trafficking Regimes
- Gendered conceptualization of refugees
    - Women and child refugees are seen as vulnerable, and deserving of pity and support
        - Women who present themselves as strong, determined, and confident are less likely to receive assistance as they do not fit the narrative of poor, inept, women fleeing the abusive conditions of their home countries and husbands
    - Men are viewed as foreign criminals who 

- The process of refugee determination creates two identities: the First World savior and the Third World Other, the refugee-accepting countries and the refugee-producing countries

- Idea of the **"Third World Woman"**

- The archetypal refugee of the past was implicitly defined as an active, heterosexual, adult male “heroically trying to assert his (typically  male) individuality against an oppressive state
    - Today, “refugeeness” is often embodied by women and children, and a “woman with child.” This is the case, not just because most refugees are women and children but because refugees by definition are those who need to be helped and they must display their **helplessness**

- The rise of anti-trafficking campaigns and measures that in an effort to assist female and child migrants, affirmed perceptions of third world women and children as victims devoid of personal agency, compared to men who have "too much agency" to be considered a victim and deserving of refugee support
    - The notion of a male victim clashes with these perceptions that only women and children should be deserving of support as they are the quintessential victims who cannot help themselves

- These preconceptions about victim-hood and who should be deemed a victim apply to the context of the Chinese migrants as it explains why most women and children were accepted while almost all men were sent back (men cant be victims and those who are not victims don't deserve support)
    - It also explains why women who were seen as too strong were sent back as they did not align with the perception of a woman as a helpless victim

## The Politics of Pity: The Refugee Claims of the Chinese Migrants of 1999
> "Like refugee advocates, the media frequently represented Chinese women, girls, and boys as potential victims of the global sex trade. Thus two gendered and aged categories of irregular migration appear to exist: smuggled adult male economic migrants (often referred to simply as “the migrants”) and persecuted and/or trafficked women and children who may be forced to work in the sex trade. It is by fitting into this latter category that claimants may be recognized as refugees"

- The refugee claims of the Chinese migrants had a success rate of 4% (compared to the national average of 50%) and 79% of these successful claims were made by women and children

- the **politics of pity** “needs to configure suffering as recognizable, something the spectators can identify and sympathize with.” Since the 1980's the legitimized form of suffering for Chinese women has primarily been centered on the dictates of China’s one-child policy
    - Claims based on the one-child policy are inherently gendered towards women and any men making refugee claims citing this reason were unsuccessful, while claims based on religious persecution were inherently male

## Women, Men, and Gendered Persecution
- Discussions of the migrants’ poverty, rather than their claims to persecution, reinforced the general conclusion that they were economic migrants, poverty seemed to contribute to ideas of victim-hood for the women by making them vulnerable to the abuses of Chinese men and the state
    - Poverty in relation to women strengthens their victimization while in men is often not an adequate enough criteria; poverty does not support male victim-hood

- Gendered distinctions between the public and the private, the mind and the body, and the "hero" and the victim
    - Men are associated with the public (belong in the workplace/society), the mind, and the "hero" (not needing of support or pity), while women are associated with the private (belong in the home), the body (reproduction), and the victim
    - Women are dependent daughters, wives, and mothers and men are individual citizens persecuted by an oppressive state

- Examination of the successful claims reveals that the men who were successful were those who drew on narratives of masculine heroism and claimed refugee status due to religious persecution while the women who made similar claims based in religious were unsuccessful
