# GEOG310 - Week 4: Irregular Migration & Moral Panic

# Lecture Notes: Irregular Migration
- **Topics covered in this lecture:**
    - Question the discourse of "illegal migrants"
    - Identify some aspects of the experiences of "irregular" migrants
    - Terminology: illegalized vs. illegal migrant

## Immigration/Refugees Categories in Canada
- Various ways one may cross the border into Canada:
    - Family reunification:
        - members of the family class
    - Humanitarian:
        - Convention refugees
        - Members of designated classes; persons eligible under special humanitarian measures
    - Economic/business immigrants:
        - Entrepreneurs
        - Self-employed persons
        - Investors
        - Retirees
        - Other independent immigrants

## What does "Illegal" Migration Generally Refer To
- Anyone who's movement has not been sanctioned by the state

- Processes that can "illegalize" a migrant:
    - Someone who has entered with false documents
    - Unauthorized entry
    - Overstayed visa or work permit
    - Rejected asylum seeker

- Hanan stresses the importance of **language** and how it dictate the discourse surrounding refugees

## How Many People are Illegalized Migrants in Canada?
- Short answer is we don't know due to lack of data however it is an estimated 0.2-1.5 percent of Canada's population

## Canada Immigration and Refugee Protection Act

## The Nation-State Retains the Power to Detain an Illegalized Migrant If...
- They pose a public safety threat
- There is a fear the illegalized migrant might flee (Ex: go underground)
- The government is unsure of who they are (they cannot prove their identity)

## UN Convention on Refugees
- "The convention further stipulates that, subject to specific exceptions, **refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry or stay**. This recognizes that the seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules..."

## "Irregular Arrivals"
- Undocumented
- Unauthorized
- Clandestine
- Illegalized migrants

- Imagined difference between the migrants and citizens of a nation-state that will inhibit their integration; justification for inhibiting their migration to a nation-state

## Should Illegalized Migrants be Offered Amnesty?
- **Reasons for amnesty:**
    - Most illegalized have come because they are in search of work or safety. If they are "unskilled" labor, they have few means to enter through an immigration system
    - Border patrols, walls, and militarized enforcement of borders is expensive
    - Migrants are integral to the economy, specific industries rely on cheap migrant labor (Ex: US agriculture)
- **Reasons against amnesty:**
    - Amnesty would encourage more illegal migration, and undercut the wages of a local labor force
    - The government should not reward those who break the law
    - Sovereignty of the nation depend on a country's ability to police its borders

# Reading Notes: Illegalized Migrants - Hannan
- **"Illegal" migrant** = people who are not accepted to immigrate to a country however choose to migrate there anyways through their own means
    - "Illegal" migrants are denied many rights that citizens and other immigrants take for granted
    - Referring to illegal migrants as "Illegals" is problematic because only an activity can be "illegal", not an entire person
    - The term **"illegalized migrant"** has gained popularity because it draws attention to state policies that render migrants "illegal"

- Migrants can become illegalized through many channels:
    - Crossing the border while circumventing detection by authorities
    - Enter a country with fraudulent documentation
    - Arrive legally on a tourist, student, or worker visa but stay beyond the visa's expiry date
    - Cross the border as a refugee but stay when their refugee claim is rejected
    - Many migrants also become illegalized due to backlogs in the processing of their refugee or immigration papers

- Once illegalized, migrants are subject to incarceration and deportation if they are caught by the police or reported to immigration officials

## A Brief History of Illegalization
- Four phases of migrant illegalization, each marked by different immigration policies that affected migrants' legal status
    1. 1860's and 1870's: selective "open door" immigration policies
    2. 1880's to 1950's: racist immigration policies
    3. 1960's and 1970's: skill based immigration policies
    4. 1980's to present: skill based immigration policies

## Illegalized Immigrants in the Labor Market
- **Neoclassical labor market theory** =

# Lecture Notes: Moral Panic
- Previous class:
    - Importance of **language**; words have meaning and matter because they dictate **discourse**

- **Question of this class:** how are the experiences of refugees being presented in the media?; how does representation in media affect **discourse** and encourage **moral panic**

## Tamil Refugee Situation
- Tamil refugees paid human smugglers to leave Sri Lanka and migrate to Canada
- As the refugees arrived on Canadian shores, they were detained by Canadian Border Security

- The arrival of Tamil refugees in Canada by **boat** (irregular form of transport) instigated fear and anxiety among the Canadian population; fear of the arrival of criminals and terrorists and the encouragement of other groups migrating to Canada in this way (unannounced and unregulated)
    - Idea of boats being associated with illegality and unregulated travel

- **What cause this change in reaction to providing support to migrants arriving by boat?**
    - Controversial change in Canadian immigration policy (Bill C-11)

# Reading Notes: Mystery Ships and Risky Boat People - Bradimore
> ABSTRACT ~ On October 17, 2009, seventy-six Tamil refugees arrived off the coast of Victoria, British Columbia. This study examines how the Canadian newsprint media portrayed this event and in which policy context this coverage occurred. We analyze articles published between October 2009 and January 2010 from the Vancouver Sun, the Toronto Star, and the National Post. A discourse analysis addresses issues of framing, representation, and identity to understand how the Tamil refugee migration was represented in media debate. Our results show that there was an overall negative representation of the Tamil refugees as the press emphasized issues of criminality and terrorism, and constructed the refugees as risk. The discussion established security—rather than human rights—as a focal point and portrayed the immigration system as both “failing” and “abused” by “bogus claimants.” This security-oriented framework provided a discursive background for the refugee reform Bill C-11 to be ushered through Parliament later that summer

- Article is examining the discourse and representation surrounding Tamil refugees in the media discourse and how this influenced/caused their (cold) reception among the Canadian population
    - **Discourse** refers to the narrative surrounding the refugees; who is controlling the narrative, what terms codify this narrative, how has this narrative affecting/instigated **"moral panic"**

- In 1986 and 1987, Canada was shocked at the arrival of boats carrying **Tamil and Sikh refugees**
- A year later in 1988, government began working on new legislation to overhaul the system; **Bill C-55**
    - Bill C-55 officially amended the Immigration Act (Canada, 2002), creating the “quasi” independent Immigration and Refugee Board, with the intention to reduce “bogus” refugee claimants

- Canada’s reluctance to accept **“boat people”**
    - Their unexpected arrival sends waves of anxiety through public discourse and the state’s response is immediately one of **risk management** (the boat is seized, refugees are detained, terrorism experts are consulted, policies are scrutinized, and new legislation is drafted)
        - These actions aim to both contain immediate risks and minimize future risks. Yet throughout the process, **the voices of the migrants are silenced**

- During the 1999 and 2009 boat arrivals, the media perpetuated an image of the migrants as **"exhausted, weakened, and unkempt criminals”**; the people most in need of humanitarian compassion and protection are dehumanized and framed as a risk to be managed, an "other"
    - Canadian media relied heavily on terms of **“illegality”** to describe the Tamil refugees, which worked to legitimize their detention and established the necessary political environment in which the federal government could quickly usher in Bill C-11 (bill to deal with "bogus" refugee claimants)

- Studies on the media representation of the refugees revealed that the discourses of **security and risk** were the dominant modes of representation in the media
    - Concept of **“lexical selectivity”**, where terms like “queue-jumper, alien, illegal, human cargo, boat people, and detainees” depersonalized and objectified the migrants and left readers with a distorted understanding of who the migrants were and what the appropriate state response should be
    - Notable is the repetitive use of the term “illegal” in the media despite the migrants’ legal rights to claim refugee status at the Canadian border; 

- **Illegality is intertwined with the migrants' mode of transportation**; he fact that migrants arrived to Canada’s shore by boat and not through ‘legal channels’ criminalized the migrants in the media's eye
    - People arriving by plane are seen as individuals rather than groups arriving "en mass" by boat is seen as an invasion; assault on sovereignty
    - Association with criminality such as smuggling and piracy; boat travel is less regulated than air travel
