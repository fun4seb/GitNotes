# GEOG310 - Week 5: Sanctuary Cities & Biopower/State of Exception

# Lecture Notes: Sanctuary Cities
- **What is sanctuary?**
    - A space of refuge and safety; shelter from harm
    - Symbology of a **church** as a sanctuary to seek refuge; dating back to medieval times
    
- **How might one come to need sanctuary?**
    - If you are undocumented in a country, causing you to **not utilize support systems for fear of discovery** (cant call police, use healthcare, seek shelter, flee abusive relationships, etc.)

- 1980's is when we start to see sanctuary cities emerge in the US
    - Civil war in Guatemala and El Salvador created refugees that were denied refuge in the USA and were sent back

- **Convivial Cosmopolitan**
    - "The processes of cohabitation and interaction that have made multi-culture an ordinary feature of social life in Britain's urban centers and post colonial cities elsewhere... in which cultures, histories, and structures of feeling previously separated by enormous distances could be found in the same place, time, school, bus, cafe, cell, waiting room, or traffic jam"
    - Cities offer the potential for human connectedness 

- **What are the limits of sanctuary?**
    - Only in place to mitigate effects of state-sanctioned violence against migrants and cannot solve the larger structural issues at hand
    - May lure people into a false sense of security
    - Fails to undo questions of "deservingness" surrounding refugees

# Reading Notes: Building the Sanctuary City from the Ground Up - Jeffries & Ridgley
- Policing and militarization of borders as **state-sanctioned violence**

- An increasing number of cities have responded to the escalation of border policing by declaring themselves as "sanctuary cites"; cities where you can exist safely without risk of being subjected to state-sanctioned violence for being an undocumented citizen

- Sanctuary cities assist migrant communities by passing **sanctuary policies:**
    - Limiting local cooperation with federal immigration law enforcement
    - Affirm and support the rights of refugees and migrants
    - Increase or protect access to municipal services and supports
    
- Important role sanctuary city movements have played in providing a ‘ground floor of survival’ and the first line of defense against immigration enforcement, as well as enacting a **form of citizenship not rooted in the sovereignty of the nation state**
    - Idea of there being more than one type of citizen; broadening the scope of what it means to be a citizen and deserving of rights

## Sanctuary City Organizing in Canada and Ottawa
- "In Canada, there have been active sanctuary city campaigns since the early 2000's, when the activist network No One Is Illegal (NOII) and groups of non-status migrants began advocating for Don’t Ask, Don ’t Tell (DADT) 1 or Access Without Fear policies in Toronto and Vancouver"
    - Such measures aim to restrict the conditions under which police and social service providers collect and share information with federal immigration authorities
    
- After Trump was elected there was an explosion of interest surrounding sanctuary cities in Canada fueled by anti-Trump sentiments, causing many Canadian cities to brand themselves as "sanctuary cities", regardless of if they have enacted policy to protect the interests of migrants
    - Idea of sanctuary cities as a brand; "Increasingly, local political figures in Canada have seized on the idea of the Sanctuary City to brand their city as welcoming without making material changes to the way the police or service providers participate in immigration law enforcement"
    
## Non-Reformist Reform and Abolition
- Distinction between **reformist reform** vs. **non-reformist (revolutionary) reform**; idea proposed by New Left theorist and activist **Andre Gorz**
    - **Reformist reform** = reforms geared towards maintaining or salvaging existing social orders; slowly tweaking and changing the system rather than radical transformation (revolution) and abolition of systems
    - **Non-reformist reform** = reforms geared towards radical change and overhaul/abolition of existing systems; "non-reformist reforms are ‘determined not in terms of what can be, but what should be’, allowing workers to build and expand power in a manner that will weaken capitalism and ‘shake its joints’"
    - The distinction provides the basis for determining which kinds of actions or initiatives will guide struggles towards structural change and which strengthen status quo social arrangements
    
- Abolitionist scholars and organizers such as Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2007) and Mariame Kaba (2017) have picked up on Gorz’s formulation and revised it to provide a framework for **prison and police abolition movements**
    
> "The distinction between reformist reforms and non-reformist reforms can provide a strong principle for sanctuary by helping us establish which kinds of sanctuary practices, goals and proposals help us address immediate and urgent needs in our community while at the same time undermining the state’s capacity to divide people and punish those with precarious immigration status."

## Sanctuary as Reformist Reform
- Sanctuary movements tend to erupt in times of emergency. These movements are diverse, but there are common features or tendencies that turn up routinely, and these provide us with examples to scrutinize or warn against:
    1. **Symbolic sanctuary**
        - Symbolic declarations by city officials that their cities are ‘sanctuaries’ for refugees and people living with precarious migration status
        - While these pronouncements may be intended to convey sentiments of solidarity to migrant communities, such declarations come with **no guarantee of material support** for training service providers, nor do they show any interest (or capacity) to address the problem of reigning in police and border enforcement agencies
        - Another problem with such symbolic declarations is that they render people living with precarious migration status more vulnerable by **falsely implying they are protected from apprehension and deportation**
        - Ex:Vancouver, New York, Montreal, Toronto, and Mexico City are just a few cities that have declared themselves sanctuaries without establishing vigorous frameworks for providing access to vital services. Nor have these cities provided clear, enforceable proposals, let alone guarantees, that will halt police profiling or collaboration with federal immigration authorities
    2. **Sanctuary as community policing**
        - In North America, sanctuary policies have become part of a portfolio of initiatives designed to improve **community policing**, where support is built on the hope of strengthening relationships between police and migrant or racialized communities
        - City officials, police associations, and activists have all justified sanctuary city policies as pragmatic initiatives to make the city ‘safer’, as people living with precarious immigration status are allegedly more likely to contact and share information with police if they feel they will not be reported to the immigration authorities
        - This framing equates the police with safety and presupposes the state is protective rather than the creator and enforcer of the very policies that put people at risk of detention and deportation
    3. **Sanctuary as politics of division**
    4. **The problem of familism**
