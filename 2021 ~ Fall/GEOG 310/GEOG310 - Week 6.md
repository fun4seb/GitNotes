# GEOG310 - Week 6: Australian Refugee Policy & Refugee Camps

# Lecture Notes: Australian Refugee Policy & Forced Migration
- **Questions of this class:**
    1. Why are refugees leaving for Australia?; Why do people leave their home?
        - "No one puts their children on a boat unless the water is safer than the land"; refugees obviously under extreme circumstances

## Geography of Australia
- Island continent; surrounded by water
    - Which means all its borders are permeable; **can be reached by boat**
- A country of the global North, surrounded by countries considered to be in the Global South; power dynamic

- **Islands as "spaces of exception":**
    - **Spaces of exception** = remote spaces, away from public gaze (penal colonies such as Alcatraz, Devil's Island, etc.)
    - Porous borders
    - Colonial fantasies of primitive adventures or sexual excess (Pacific) or danger (cannibalism)
    - Islands as a semi-laboratory setting (Ex: Guantanamo bay experimentations)
    - Thought to be insular but also more communal; hospitable smallness? Is an island a small place or is an Island a world?
    - Sentinel Island (geopolitical significance)

## Australia Refugee Policy
- In 2013, Australia enacted a "no boats" policy and began stopping maritime arrivals of asylum seekers to Australia and began detaining them on remote islands (The Pacific Solution)
    - Boats being related to human smuggling

### Immigrants vs. Refugees in Australia
- Up until mid-1970's Australia had a "White Australia" policy
    - Aimed at blocking immigrants from Asia to Australia

- Today, Australia sees itself as a multicultural (connection to Europe is weakening, new connections made with Asia, Aboriginal ancestry is being acknowledged more openly)
    - Today "legal" migrants with **skills** are welcome in Australia; professionals are encouraged to immigrate
    - Technically Australia is willing to accept a limited number of refugees, but **not by boat**
        - Lingering idea that immigrants from a different culture might corrode the way of life or "overrun" the existing population if a country "lets in too many" migrants

### The Pacific Solution
- **The Pacific Solution** = Australian immigration policy of holding undocumented asylum-seekers in island detention centers; enacted to deal with the excess number of undocumented refugees
    - Australia pays neighboring islands to house new migrants before they can get the adequate papers; display of colonial/North-South power relationship
    - The implication of hiding refugees and migrants on remote islands is they are **less visible**; more likely to be abused without consequences or knowledge of outside powers

- This policy is controversial because it satisfies the obligations of UN convention signatories by not returning refugees home (non-refoulement) but it does this by instead housing them on islands in questionable conditions
    - Just another way of limiting migrants from entering the border

- Refugees receive basic food and shelter, basic education for children, **but no promise of a future**
    - Australia is ensuring their right to apply for refugee status however is **not obligated to accept the refugees**

- **Illegalization of asylum seekers:**
    - Illegalization of asylum seekers by imprisoning them on islands and stopping them from entering Australia (or leaving)
    - Shifts responsibility of the detention of asylum seekers onto offshore pacific islands

- Why would smaller islands nations (like Nauru) accept refugees?
    - Much needed aid provided by Australia to house refugees boosts the economy
    - Australia is exerting its colonial power on surrounding global South nations
