# GEOG310 - Week 7: Risk of Death & Necropolitics

# Lecture Notes: Risk of Death

# Reading Notes: Death at Sea, Migration and the gendered dimensions of border insecurity - Pickering & Powell

# Lecture Notes: Necropolitics
- **Necropolitics** = the politics of death
    - Who lives? Who dies? Who decides?

- Deaths as more than just statistics
    - Case of Omid Masoumali who attempted suicide through self-immolation after being placed in detention in Nauru, and would have lived if he were given the proper medical care found in Australia
        - Idea that suicide is the only thing that provides someone **agency** over their own body when their rights and freedoms has been taken away (Ex: refugees detained on island detention centers)

## Foucault & Biopower
- **Biopower according to Foucault** = the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species become the subject of 
    - Biopower is based on the control of populations; the control of **lives**

- **Biopolitics** = the politics surrounding the control of **human life**

- Idea proposed by Mbembe that biopower/biopolitics is not sufficient to understand the politics of the death of entire populations

## Mbembe & Necropolitics
- Mbembe is influenced by Agamben and Hannah Arendt; context of a Jew fleeing Nazi Germany
    - Nazi Germany as a state focused on the control of **death**

- "But under what practical conditions is the **right to kill, to allow to life, or to expose to death exercised?**"
    - Is the notion of biopower sufficient to account for the contemporary ways in which the political makes the murder of the enemy its primary and absolute objective?

- **State of exception** = 
    - "Others" are made "not human" in order to exercise violence upon

- It is the labeling and differentiation of populations (Ex: colonial scramble for Africa) that allows for "others" to be created for conflict to emerge between once unified populations

- According to Mbembe it is the **colonies** that act as the origin of Necropolitics
    - Colonies as spaces of complete control over the life of those colonized; colonies as **zones of exception**
        - Colonized bodies (Ex: slaves) are not given the same consideration as a subjects of the state

- Idea of a **social death** = when someones identity and life is taken away from them as they are forced into slavery/refuge and reduced to an expendable body; the death of them as a social being

# Reading Notes: Necropolitics - Mbembe
- To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality and to define life as the deployment and manifestation of power

- **Biopower according to Foucault:** that domain of life over which power has taken control

> "under what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death exercised?  Who  is  the  subject  of  this  right?  What  does  the  implementation  of such a right tell us about the person who is thus put to death and about the relation of  enmity  that  sets  that  person  against  his  or  her  murderer?"

## Politics, the Work of Death, and the “Becoming Subject”

- Reading starts from the idea that **modernity** was at the origin of multiple concepts of sovereignty — and therefore of the biopolitical. Disregarding this multiplicity, late-modern political criticism has unfortunately privileged normative theories of democracy and has made the concept of **reason** one of the most important elements of both the project of modernity and of the topos of sovereignty

- Sovereignty is therefore defined as a twofold process of self-institution and self-limitation (fixing one’s own limits for oneself)
    - The exercise of sovereignty, in turn, consists in society’s capacity for self-creation through recourse to institutions inspired by specific social and imaginary significations
    
- Hegel’s  discussion  of  the  relation  between death and the **“becoming subject”**
    - Hegel’s account of death centers on a **bipartite concept of negativity**
        - First, the human negates nature (a negation exteriorized in the human’s effort to reduce nature to his or her own needs
        - Second, he or she transforms the negated element through work and struggle. In transforming nature, the human being creates a world; but in the process, he or she also is exposed to his  or her own negativity
        -  Within  the  Hegelian  paradigm,  human death is essentially voluntary. It is the result of risks consciously assumed by the subject. According to Hegel, in these risks the “animal” that constitutes the human subject’s natural being is defeated
    - In other words, the human being truly becomes a subject (separated from  the  animal) in the struggle and the work through which he or she confronts death (understood as the violence of negativity)
