# Reading Notes: "The Migrant Crisis" as Racial Crisis, Do Black Lives Matter in Europe? - De Genova
- **Abstract:** Despite the persistence of racial denial and the widespread refusal to frankly confront questions of "race" across Europe, the current constellation of "crises" presents precisely what can only be adequately comprehended as an unresolved **racial crisis** that derives fundamentally from the postcolonial condition of "Europe" as a whole, and therefore commands heightened scrutiny and rigorous investigation of the material and practical as well as discursive and symbolic productions of the co-constituted figures of "Europe" and "crisis" in light of racial formations theory

- Crisis at the borders of Europe for migrants and refugees
    - Mediterranean sea as the global epicenter for lethal border crossing
        - Ex: Shipwrecks and mass deaths of migrants on boats in the Mediterranean
    - Racial component of the deadly European border regime; seldom acknowledged because it highlights the post-colonialism of the "new" Europe
        -   The mobility of the vast majority of people from formerly colonized countries has been preemptively illegalized

- Labor migrants and refugees who cannot secure visas are compelled to first arrive on European territory as "unauthorized" asylum-seekers, and hence, as de facto "illegal migrants" who only thereafter may petition for asylum; migrants are illegalized from the start
    - Furthermore, the European asylum system only grants refugee status to less than 15 percent of applicants. Thus the EU legal framework governing travel visas, migration, and asylum, together with the externalization of border policing and transportation of carrier sanction, preclude literally the vast majority of humanity from "legitimate" access to the European Union

## Migrant lives/"Black" Lives
- Migrants are de-racialized and disconnected from their racial identities; idea of "anti-racism" in post-holocaust Europe despite racism obviously still being rampant
- The “migrant crisis” of Europe must be understood to be a historical moment of **racial crisis**
    - Point of the author is that we must acknowledge the racial components to migrant crises

## "Terrorists"
- Terrorist events get associated with migrants and affect policies affecting migration and freedom of movement of specifically Muslim migrants
    - Terrorists events served to justify heightened border militarization

- Formation of “the Muslim” as Europe’s premier **Other**
    - a racialized condensation of un-reason, manifested as religious fundamentalism, fanaticism, and terrorism

## "Sexual Predators"
- Moral panic of Muslims as sexual predators
    - Sexual assaults occurring during the New Year’s Eve festivities in Cologne, Germany reinvigorated the racialization of “Muslim” identity as that of unruly men prone to toxic sexual behavior
    - Rationalization for denying Muslim asylum seekers

- Eurocentric leftist philosopher **Zizek**
    - Zizek is supporting the European “militarization” of migration management
    - Advocates a militarist Eurocentrism with regard to imposing an unprecedented level of control over the borders of “Europe” and all those who may become the presumptive beneficiaries of Europe’s “hospitality”

# Podcast Notes: WNYC Radiolab: Border Trilogy (Part 1)
> While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh. This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called “Prevention Through Deterrence.”

- Podcast starts with the author (Jason, an archeologist) recounting his travels to the Sonoran desert to uncover what migrants travelling through the desert leave behind (Ex: clothes, photos, toys, etc.)
    - The author continues collecting and detailing all the items he is finding in the desert (left by migrants) **until he finds a human arm**

- **Jason's question:** How did it get to be that so many people cross into America through the desert? 

- "It used to be that if you wanted to cross the US-Mexican border you’d go down to Tijuana at dusk, a place called the soccer field, you would hop the fence with about a hundred other people and you would just bum rush the border patrol, and half of you would get by, would make it into the US, and the other half would get caught and sent back and people would do it the next day" **what changed?**
    - In the mid-90s, there was a lot of pushback against the visibility of fence hopping
    - Starts with the story of a Texas highschool filled with mostly Mexican-Americans, where in the 90s **students started being stopped by border patrol officers and harrassed to prove their citizenship**
