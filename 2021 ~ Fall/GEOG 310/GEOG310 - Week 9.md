# Film Review Notes: Human Flow - Ai Weiwei
- **Film review questions:**
    1. Briefly summarize the topic of the film
    2.  What are its themes? What issues does the film-maker raise? What is the purpose of the film?
        - Hopelessness
        - Vulnerability
        - (lack of) fairness/justice
        - Liminality
    3. Evaluate the representation of refugees in the films. How are refugees portrayed? How are these portrayals in conversation with our readings? Are the representations of refugees helpful to raising awareness and ultimately supporting those fleeing persecution, conflict, etc? What are your critique(s) of the film?
        - Refugees as people in a state of permanent transit and displacement
        - Allowing people to become refugees as an act of cruelty; robbing people of all security and normalcy, reducing them to helpless people without agency over their future at the mercy of unwelcoming host countries
        - The film is portraying refugees as people deserving of respect and humane consideration.
        - Ai Weiwei created this film to humanize refugees. To recognize each one as individuals with individual needs and aspirations beyond their immediate situation; Ai Weiwei is demanding the viewer to respect the struggles of refugees and empathize with their lives on a more personal and human level than explored by the media.
        - Displaced people as people united under a common struggle

- Association of migrants with boats
    - Film opens to a tranquil sequence, fit with soothing ambient music, of an inflatable raft full of people ending their journey as they reach the shore
    - After the raft reaches the shore the tranquil sequence shifts to more chaotic handheld footage showing the refugees taking their first steps on land; shift from calm and neutral to chaotic editing to match the 

- The film then shifts its focus to Iraq where it shows the lives of displaced peoples in Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion
    - Ai Weiwei makes it clear that the United States is responsible for the displacement of more than four million Iraqis
    - Also uses the language of invasion, recognizing that the United States directly challenged the sovereignty of Iraq with an overt and oppressive military presence
    - Ai Weiwei places deliberate focus on the day-to-day lifestyle of people living in such a liminal space; he is showing how normalized the lifestyle of these displaced people are
        - Preparing dough by a fire pit
        - Standing in line for papers
    - After an interview with two women detailing the destruction of their home cities, the camera cuts to a panning shot of urban destruction, destruction of a once peaceful home to many
        - This shot showing destruction is then juxtaposed to a shot showing locals standing in full view in front of the camera; the film is forcing the viewers to associate the consequences of destruction with those most affected and displaced
            - Most importantly the viewer is meant to associate the destruction with individuals, each with unique and complex lives, and not with a generalized group
            - The film is trying to present the mass displacement of people globally as a human issue that is not disconnected from emotion

- The film states the UN convention definition of a refugee, notably dependent on persecution, before cutting to a similar scene from before, except the boat is arriving in the middle of the night to the sound of crying babies
    - This sequence plays close attention to the lives of children and families during their journey and displacement from Syria, cutting to shots of mothers and father holding babies while they are on the phone, presumably contacting loved ones or other family, showing that these people are connected to others outside their immediate situation and once maintained "normal" lives.
    - The film then cuts to a rescue volunteer explaining the dangers of the ocean, especially along rocky coasts like the landing site, and how easy it is to panic and be swept overboard. This is followed by shots showing floating life preservers, devoid of people and the very life they are meant to preserve. Life preservers are usually a symbol of safety or assistance, but this sequence is so abundant with empty floating life vests, tools that presumably once held and supported a migrant life, are transformed into symbols of death at sea. Ai Weiwei is shown walking along a beach with particularity rough waves where a lone life jacket has washed ashore.
        - Association of sea with death

- Rohinga guy talking about how his people are human too and have feelings and are individuals not be the generalized under labels and stereotypes as they are people two and therefore just as complex and and with nuanced lives as the rest of us
    - Answer to question 2

- The film then shows migrants in transit, groups of hundreds traveling in long columns over the landscapes of northern Greece, across treacherous rivers and along barbed wire fences
    - Idea of migrants and refugees being in a state of permanent transit sleeping and living along railway tracks in tents and out of use rail-cars
    - 13,000 people from Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria fleeing war were stuck in transit in northern Greece on their way to Germany after the Macedonian, Slovenian, Croatian, and Serbian borders were closed
    "A million people walked through this gate" (gesturing to gate of refugee camp housing displaced peoples on their way through Greece to Macedonia, then Serbia, then Croatia)

- Militarization of borders; intensification in the restriction of movement
    - Escalation of force leads to escalation of measures refugees must take to reach 

- News headline from PBS flashes "World's largest Syrian refugee camp has developed its own economy"
    - The displacement of many refugees is so severe any hope for a return to their previous life is gone

- The film also highlight the realities of refugee lives, instances of sexual violence are commonplace

- Ai Weiwei, states plainly "I respect you", when sharing passports with a Syrian man loving at a camp

- Dr. Cem Terzi explains that the people living in Turkish camps without humanitarian aid are only allowed within Turkey under temporary protection, meaning they have no international rights as refugees; Many refugees have no form of legal protection and are at the mercy of host countries who may expel them at any time due to not being recognized as a refugee.
    - Due to many displaced peoples not being recognized as refugees, it gives countries such as Turkey "just" cause to deport them and actively act against migrant interests
    - He goes on to outline actionable ways these refugees can be helped by host countries such as a creating social integration programs, issuing job permits, providing a standard livable income, education for displaced youth

- Many cuts and editing decisions in the film are deliberately jarring to represent the chaotic reality of a refugee's lifestyle

- "Prison" of Gaza

- Despite growing refugee numbers, resources for providing aid is dwindling

- The film ends on a long reverse-zoom showing an enormous and seemingly unending pile of discarded life jackets
