# What are Geographic Information Systems?
> "a powerful set of tools for storing and retrieving at will, transforming and displaying spatial data from the real  world for a particular set of purposes" (Burrough, 1986)

> "automated systems for the capture, storage, retrieval, analysis, and display of spatial data." (Clarke, 1995)

- GIS = **Geographic Information System**
    - A system that allows us to: collect, store, transform, display, analyze, and retrieve **spatial data from the real world**

- **GIS Components:**
    - Data
    - Software
    - Hardware
    - Methods
    - People
    - Network

## What can you Analyze with GIS?
- A Geographic Information System (GIS) can be used to answer **questions related to location**
- A common framework used to show possible questions that can be answered by a GIS was initially defined within the area of Geography: **What is Where, Why There, and Why care?** This framework can be applied to all areas that have a spatial component

### Example: Dr. John Snow’s map (1854)
- 1850's understanding of cholera > spread by miasma in the air (”bad air”); germs were not yet understood (germ theory of disease developed later in 1880)
    - Sudden and serious outbreak of cholera in London's Soho = a mystery! (for 1850)
- Snow mapped out the locations of the local water wells and cholera deaths to back his argument about the disease spreading through a contaminated pump, convincing the local council to remove the handle to prevent its use. (He also tracked healthy people to verify his theory)
    - **Snow used spatial data to solve a real world problem**

# The Geographic Inquiry Process
- The geographic inquiry process = **"the approach"**
    1. **Ask** a geographic question (ask a question about spatial relationships in the world around you)
    2. **Acquire** geographic resources (identify data and information that you need to answer your question)
    3. **Explore** geographic data (turn the data into maps, tables, and graphs, and look for patterns and relationships)
    4. **Analyze** geographic information (determine what the patterns and relationships mean with respect to your question)
    5. **Act** on geographic knowledge (use the results of your work to educate, make a decision, or solve a problem)

# Reading Notes: Chapter 1 - An Introduction to GIS (Perusall)
- **Reading questions:**
    1. What is key to all definitions of a GIS?
        - The synthesis of "where" (spatial data) and "what" (attribute data) is what is constant within all definitions of GIS
    2. What is the definition of GIS according to this book?
        - "A GIS is a computer-based system to aid in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, output, and distribution of spatial data and information"
    3. Is there only one right way to create a specific map?
        - There is no single "correct" way to make a map, the information being presented is arranged at the discretion of the cartographer. For example on cartographer might decide to include data on roads while another cartographer making the same map might not, it all depends on the intended use of the map, audience, etc.; The final map is the result of decisions made by the map-maker and cause the finished product to be unique every time
    4. What are the components of GIS
        - The components of GIS are: hardware, software, data, humans, and organizational protocols
