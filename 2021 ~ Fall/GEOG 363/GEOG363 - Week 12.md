# GEOG363 - Week 12: Remote Sensing & Final Exam Review
- Outline:
    - Remote sensing
    - Final exam review

# Remote Sensing
- **Remote sensing** = the science and art of obtaining information about an object without touching it
    - The science and technology by which characteristics of objects can be identified without direct contact

- Why do we do remote sensing?
    - Unobtrusive
    - Automated
    - Useful for extreme conditions
    - Offers excellent spatial and temporal coverage
    - Provides real time or near real time observations
    - Often cost-effective
    - **Extends out senses**

- **Principles of remote sensing:**
    1. Physics of RS
    2. Technology of RS observing those physics
    3. Processing of data observed by RS technology
    4. Applying this data to applications of RS

## Interpretation and Analysis

## Spectral Signatures

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Boolean Operators
- **AND** = intersection of 2 sets (selects all belonging to both A AND B)
- **OR** = union of 2 sets (selects all belonging to A OR B)
- **XOR** = exclusive OR (selects all belonging to A OR B but not both)
- **NOT** = difference operator (selects all belonging to A but not B)

## GIS Data Types
- 3 main GIS data types:
    - Vector
    - Raster
    - Attribute
