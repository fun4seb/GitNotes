    - GIS data types: raster, vector, attribute data
    - Mapping
    - GIS data analysis: attribute data analysis
    - Projections

# Intro to GIS
- **GIS process:**
    1. Real world: made up of raster, vector, and attribute data
    2. Collect data about the real world
    3. Store and display this data; **mapping**
    4. Transform data: **projections**
    5. Perform analysis on the data : attribute, vector, raster
    6. Use this to inform decisions in the real world; cycle/iterative process
    

# GIS Data Types
- GIS is about representing the real world; How? Using **data**

- **Geographic data combine two types of data:**
    1. **Spatial data** = the where? (vector, raster)
    2. **Attribute data** = the what? (qualitative data; populations, area, address, etc.)

## GIS Spatial Data Structures
- **Raster** = the world consists of smooth, **continuous** fields
    - Spatial features represented by: **cells/pixels** (fields or continuous features)
- **Vector** = The world consists of sets of **discrete** objects, their attributes, and their relations
    - Spatial features represented by: **points, lines, polygons** (discrete features)

## Topological Data Model
- Topological data model allows **spatial operations** based on connectivity and neighboring (contiguity) relations:
    - Ex: Street B is connected to Street C via Street A
    - Ex: Neighbors of District A are District B,C,D, and E

## Attribute Data

- Measurement levels:
    - Nominal:
    - Ordinal:
    - Interval:
    - Ratio:
