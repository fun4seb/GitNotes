# GEOG374 - Week 1: Intro & The Natural Environment

> Plant Ecology ~ The "Sub-discipline of ecology which studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effects of environmental factors upon the abundance of plants, and the interactions among and between plants and other organisms”

- **Spectrum of plant ecology:**
    - Cell (genetic diversity, DNA) > organ (leaves, photosynthesis acclimations) > individual (presence/absence) > communities (species composition, structure) > landscape (disturbance, spatial pattern of communities)

# The Natural Environment
- **Components of the biosphere:**
    - Physical (soil, sun, heat/climate)
    - Biological

## Physical Components
- **Soil:**
    - Earth's layers: Crust, upper mantle, mantle, outer core, inner core
    - Layers of soil: organic material (plants, leaves, etc.), topsoil, subsoil, broken rock, bedrock
- **Sun:**
    - Light spectrum: ultraviolet light > visible light (photosynthesis) > infrared light (heat)
- **Heat/climate:**
    - Adiabatic cycle:
    - Changing seasons:
    - Rain shadow effect:
 
## Biological Components
- **Three domains of life:**
    1. Bacteria
    2. Archaea
    3. Eukarya (plants, protists, animals, fungi)

- **Biomes of the world:**
    - Rainforest
    - Grassland
    - Desert
    - Temperate forest
    - Boreal forest
    - Tundra
    - Polar
    - Chaparral

- **Evolution of plants:**
    1. Common green algal ancestor
    2. Charophytes (developed embryo protection)
    3. Liverworts (developed apical growth)
    4. Mosses & hornworts (developed vascular tissue)
    5. Club mosses
    6. Ferns (developed seeds)
    7. Gymnosperms (developed flowers/double fertilization/endosperm/fruit)
    8. Flowering plants
