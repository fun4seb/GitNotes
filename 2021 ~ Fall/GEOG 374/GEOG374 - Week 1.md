# GEOG374 - Week 1: Intro & The Natural Environment

> Plant Ecology ~ The "Sub-discipline of ecology which studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effects of environmental factors upon the abundance of plants, and the interactions among and between plants and other organisms”

- **Spectrum of plant ecology:**
    - Cell (genetic diversity, DNA) > organ (leaves, photosynthesis acclimations) > individual (presence/absence) > communities (species composition, structure) > landscape (disturbance, spatial pattern of communities)

# The Natural Environment
- **Components of the biosphere:**
    - Physical (soil, sun, heat/climate)
    - Biological

## Physical Components
- **Soil:**
    - Earth's layers: Crust, upper mantle, mantle, outer core, inner core
    - Layers of soil: organic material (plants, leaves, etc.), topsoil, subsoil, broken rock, bedrock
- **Sun:**
    - Light spectrum: ultraviolet light > visible light (photosynthesis) > infrared light (heat)
- **Heat/climate:**
    - Adiabatic cycle:
    - Changing seasons:
    - Rain shadow effect:
 
## Biological Components
- **Three domains of life:**
    1. Bacteria
    2. Archaea
    3. Eukarya (plants, protists, animals, fungi)

- **Biomes of the world:**
    - Rainforest
    - Grassland
    - Desert
    - Temperate forest
    - Boreal forest
    - Tundra
    - Polar
    - Chaparral

- **Evolution of plants:**
    1. Common green algal ancestor
    2. Charophytes (developed embryo protection)
    3. Liverworts (developed apical growth)
    4. Mosses & hornworts (developed vascular tissue)
    5. Club mosses
    6. Ferns (developed seeds)
    7. Gymnosperms (developed flowers/double fertilization/endosperm/fruit)
    8. Flowering plants

# Plant Biology
- **Plant forms:**
    - Tree
    - Shrub
    - Vine
    - Herbaceous plants (non-woody stemmed plants)
        - Graminoid (herbs)
        - Forb
    - Succulent
    - Fern
    - Moss
    - Algae (green)

## Plant Life Span
- **Biennial vs. Perennial**
    - **Biennial = live 2 years**
        - Flowing in second year
        - Occur in succession between ruderals and perennial plants
        - Ex: Raspberry
    - **Perennial = live several years**
        - Flowering delayed to a time with good resources and storage
        - Can die and re-emerge/regrow
        - Ex: Banana tree, trees, shrubs

## Plant Parts and Their Functions
- **Leaves**
    - Photosynthesis = (sunlight + carbon dioxide + water) -> (glucose/sugar + oxygen)
    - The leaves absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide, transforming them into oxygen, glucose (sugar), and carbon matter (in the form of growth); carbon dioxide -> oxygen and carbon plant matter

- **Stem**
    - Woody vs. herbaceous stem

- **Roots**

- **Flowers**

- **Seeds and spores**

## Seed Reproduction Cycle
1. **Sexually mature woody plant**
    - Mature plants are divided by annuals (seeds within a growing season), Biennials (seeds at their second growing season), and perennials (regrow every season)
        - Chronological vs. physiological age
2. **Reproductive buds undergo bud loss** through climate (wind) and predation (insects, bats, etc.)
3. **Flowering pollination**
    - Flowering fruit undergo **fruit loss** through climate, predation, and resource availability
    - Number of fruits increases with plant size and resource availability
4. **Mature seed**
    - Periodicity in seed production (perennial plants; mast year)
        - Mast year = year with higher than usual production of seeds
        - Frequency varies with climate conditions and species
        - Strategy = satiate seed predators
5. **Seed dispersal**
    - Benefits of seed dispersal
        - Less competition with adult plants
        - Lowers the impacts of density-dependent seed and seedling predators and pathogens (disease)
        - Helps reaching habitats favorable for the development of offspring/colonize new environments
    - Seed dispersal is accomplished through wind, animals, gravity, water (coconut), ballistic 
6. **Seed bank**
7. **Germination**
8. **Seeding bank**
9. **Established plant**
