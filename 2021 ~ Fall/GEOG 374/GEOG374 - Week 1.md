# GEOG374 - Week 1: Intro & The Natural Environment

> Plant Ecology ~ The "Sub-discipline of ecology which studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effects of environmental factors upon the abundance of plants, and the interactions among and between plants and other organisms”

- **Spectrum of plant ecology:**
    - Cell (genetic diversity, DNA) > organ (leaves, photosynthesis acclimations) > individual (presence/absence) > communities (species composition, structure) > landscape (disturbance, spatial pattern of communities); **plants can be studied at many different scale (cell > landscape)**

# The Natural Environment
- **Components of the biosphere:**
    - Physical (soil, sun, heat/climate)
    - Biological

## Physical Components
- **Soil:**
    - Earth's layers: Crust, upper mantle, mantle, outer core, inner core
    - Layers of soil: organic material (plants, leaves, etc.), topsoil, subsoil, broken rock, bedrock
- **Sun:**
    - Light spectrum: ultraviolet light > visible light (photosynthesis) > infrared light (heat)
- **Heat/climate:**
    - Adiabatic cycle:
    - Changing seasons:
    - Rain shadow effect:
 
## Biological Components
- **Three domains of life:**
    1. Bacteria
    2. Archaea
    3. Eukarya (plants, protists, animals, fungi)

- **Biomes of the world:**
    - Rainforest
    - Grassland
    - Desert
    - Temperate forest
    - Boreal forest
    - Tundra
    - Polar
    - Chaparral

- **Evolution of plants:**
    1. Common green algal ancestor
    2. Charophytes (developed embryo protection)
    3. Liverworts (developed apical growth)
    4. Mosses & hornworts (developed vascular tissue)
    5. Club mosses
    6. Ferns (developed seeds)
    7. Gymnosperms (developed flowers/double fertilization/endosperm/fruit)
    8. Flowering plants

# Plant Biology
- **Plant forms:**
    - Tree, shrub, vine (wood producing)
    - Herbaceous plants (non-woody stemmed plants)
        - Graminoid (herbs)
        - Forb (plants with flowers)
    - Succulent (waxy skin, stores water, found in deserts)
    - Fern
    - Moss
    - Algae (green)

## Plant Life Span
- **Annual vs. Biennial vs. Perennial**
    - **Annual = live 1 year**
        - Short life cycle; germination to seed in a single growing season
        - Limited by length of growing season
        - Good colonizers because they produce many seeds; aggressive growers
        - Ex: Wheat, rice
    - **Biennial = live 2 years**
        - Flowing in second year
        - Occur in succession between ruderals (annuals) and perennial plants
        - Ex: Raspberry
    - **Perennial = live several years**
        - Flowering is delayed to a time with good resources and storage
        - Can regrow if cut or dead
        - Ex: Banana tree, trees, shrubs

## Plant Parts and Their Functions
- **Leaves**
    - Photosynthesis = (sunlight + carbon dioxide + water) -> (glucose/sugar + oxygen)
    - The leaves absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide, transforming them into oxygen, glucose (sugar), and carbon matter (in the form of growth); carbon dioxide -> oxygen and carbon plant matter

- **Stem**
    - Role of stem is to hold leaves as well as transport the water from the soil to the leaves, the stems also circulate sugars and compounds to other parts of the plant
    - Woody vs. herbaceous stem
    - Some trees can photosynthesize through the stems

- **Roots**
    - Capture water and nutrients in the soil
    - Stores reserves, such as starch in potatoes
    - Can sometimes be involved in reproduction of the plant

- **Flowers**
    - Can be different shapes, colors, and configurations

- **Seeds and spores**
    - Plants can produce different types of seeds, protected within different types of organs
        - Seeds within a cone (pine cone)
        - Within a fleshy organ (apples)
        - Spores

# Seed Reproduction Cycle
1. **Sexually mature woody plant**
    - Mature plants are divided by annuals (seeds produced within a growing season), Biennials (seeds produced in their second growing season), and perennials (regrow every season)
        - Chronological vs. physiological age; plants can grow at different rates and the same plant can be at a different stage in its cycle than another due to better or worse conditions, so its helpful to view trees as having "2 ages"
2. **Reproductive buds are formed** 
    - Bud loss can occur through climate (wind, freeze, drought) and predation (insects, bats, etc.)
3. **Flowering pollination**
    - Flowering fruit can become pollinated through climate (wind), predation, and resource availability
        - Some plants may develop flowers with specific colors, or smells to attract predictors to spread their seed
    - Number of fruits increases with plant size and resource availability
4. **Mature seed**
    - Periodicity in seed production (perennial plants; mast year)
        - Mast year = year with higher than usual production of seeds
        - Frequency varies with climate conditions and species
        - Strategy = satiate seed predators
5. **Seed dispersal**
    - Benefits of seed dispersal
        - Less competition with adult plants
        - Lowers the impacts of density-dependent seed and seedling predators and pathogens (disease)
        - Helps reaching habitats favorable for the development of offspring/colonize new environments
    - Seed dispersal is accomplished through wind, animals, gravity, water (coconut), ballistic 
6. **Seed bank**
7. **Germination**
8. **Seeding bank**
9. **Established plant**

## Plant Establishment Case Study
> An area was harvested of its trees and the tops and branches were left on the ground to germinate, after a while the area was only covered by graminoids (herbs) rather than new growing tree saplings, Why?

- **Hypothesis of instructor:**
    - Site preparation (clearing offcuts with bulldozers and chains) killed or weakened root suckers (trembling aspen)
    - Seed rain from adjacent forests did not cover the whole area
    - Poor seedbeds
    - Competition from graminoid impeded tree growth (aspens and spruces)
    - Planted white spruce not adapted to full exposure -> slowly developed an adequate root system
