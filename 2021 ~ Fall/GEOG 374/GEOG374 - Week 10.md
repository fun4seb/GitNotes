# GEOG374 - Week 10: Disturbances (Wind & Herbivory)
- Disturbances:
    - Wind
    - Herbivory

# Wind
- Causes of damages:
    - Tornadoes, hurricanes/typhoon, and macroburst (mass amount of wind moving downward)
        - Large scale events
    - Wind gust (sudden increase in wind velocity) and microburst (smaller scale macroburst)
        - Smaller scale events
        - Many ecosystems
    - Downslope windstorms (wind moving downhill, gaining so much speed it causes damages to ecosystem)

## Damages
- Stem breakage vs. uprooting
    - Point of breakage can occur at the base (due to soil) or partway up the stem (due to weakness of tree)

- Wind applies **lateral force** (pushing trees sideways, bending at the base) while gravity applies **downward force** simultaneously while the tree is off its center, damaging the tree if forces are strong enough

- **Tree characteristics affecting damage level**
    - Crown size (larger crown captures more wind like a sail)
    - Crown density (determines how permeable the wind is when moving through the crown)
    - Crown mass (heavier crowns are more top-heavy and increase the impact of gravity; notable during freezing rain and snow as it increases the weight of the crown)
    - Stem mass (related to wood density; determines how resistant it is to physical forces)
    - Stem elasticity (more elastic stems can better respond to wind and are less likely to brake compared to rigid stems)
    - Tree height (the higher the tree the more it will catch the wind)
    - Tip displacement

- **Factors affecting damage level of wind:**
    - **Stand (community)**
        - Density (low vs. high)
        - Species composition (different species respond differently to wind)
        - Age (young vs. old; older trees usually have more stem decay i.e. weaker)
    - **Soil (ability to anchor roots in the soil)**
        - Soil depth
        - Height of water table (roots cannot grow below the water table due to lack of oxygen, meaning the deeper a water table is the deeper the roots can grow; shallow water tables lead to shallow, weak root systems)
    - **Topographic exposure**
        - Wind concentrates as it flows upward over hills
        - Wind flowing through a valley (like a river) is strongest at the peak and valley
        - Wind flowing across a valley is strongest at the peak and weakest in the valley (wind shade)

## Wind Disturbance in Dune Communities
- **Response of plants to wind** is determined by:
    - Frequency and magnitude of soil movements
    - Legacy

## Wind Summary
- Damages by wind occur at different scales
    - Ex: hurricanes; larger, microburst; smaller
- Damages to trees depends on wind velocity, tree characteristics (Ex: length of crown), the surroundings of the trees (Ex: soil depth), and the location in the landscape (Ex: bottom of valley)
- Impacts of wind on dune communities depends on the frequency of disturbance and the magnitude of change in growing conditions (sand erosion or deposition)

# Herbivory
- **Case study:** Impact of Earth insects on Mars ecosystems
