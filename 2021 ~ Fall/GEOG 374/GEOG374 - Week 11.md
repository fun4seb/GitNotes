# GEOG374 - Week 11: Disturbances (Herbivory)
- Disturbances:
    - Herbivory

# Herbivory
- **Herbivory** = consumption of all or part of a living plant

- Examples of herbivores:
    - Mammals
    - Insects
    - Fungi
    - Viruses

- Which parts of plants are consumed?
    - Foliage
    - Flowers
    - Fruits/seeds
    - Cambrium
    - Sap
    - Roots

## Population Dynamics of Herbivores
- Key agents influencing the state of herbivore population growth
    - **Silviculture hypothesis** = population is related to food availability; rise in population because there is more food available, or population collapse because there is not enough food available
        - Low density of plants = low availability and high vigor of preferred host
        - Rising plant supply = age-related decline in tree resistance; diminished predator community complexity/impact
        - Declining plant supply = resource collapse leading to population decline (lack of resource availability)
    - **Multiple Equilibria hypothesis** = population is regulated by natural enemies, and also food availability
        - Low density of plants = natural enemy control
        - Rising plant supply = favorable climate (i.e. warm, dry spring weather), resource pulse (i.e. periodic pollen cone production), moth invasion
        - Declining plant supply = resource collapse
    - **Oscillatory hypothesis** = 
        - Low density of plants = natural enemy control
        - Rising plant supply = population escapes natural enemy control due to decline in enemy abundance/impact
        - Declining plant supply = Mortality of older larvae and pupae with (sometime) synergistic impacts of resource collapse

- Outbreak every 30-40 years

## Tree Mortality Patterns
- Mortality of trees is associates to the ability of trees to recover from defoliation; **any factor limiting a trees ability to recover from defoliation leads to higher mortality (death)**
    - Mature > (more likely to die than) young
    - Density: high > low
    - Soil texture: course = very fine > medium
    - Drainage: rapid = low > good
    - Soil thickness: very thin > thin > thick
    - Ecological region: north > south

- Defoliation varies with species composition of neighboring tree species

## Grazing
- **Grazing** = to feed on grass
- **Browsing** = to feed on leaves, shoots, fruits, and other vegetation growing **high above the ground**
    - "Browse line" = line through the trees where grazing (feeding on foliage low to the ground) stops and browsing (feeding on foliage higher up) begins

- **Characteristics of grazing:**
    - Specific
    - Taller plants more likely to be affected
    - Grazing as a disturbance has:
        - Variable size
        - Variable frequency
        - Variable severity

- **Responses to grazing:**
    - Species favored when grazing is present:
        - Short plants
        - Plants with leaves near the ground
        - Plants with intercalary meristems (see Lecture 4)
        - Plants reproducing vegetatively (Ex: stolon, rhizomes)
    - Variable impact of grazing on the biodiversity of communities:
        - Favorable (competitive plants eaten)
        - Detrimental (competitive plants left)
        - Limited (plants eaten equally)

- **Impact of the exclusion of grazers:**
    - Initial impacts:  
        - Plants reproducing vegetatively and larger plants are favored
    - Long term impacts:
        - Dominance of more competitve plants
        - Possible conversion from grassland to shrubland to forest

## Plant Defense Mechanisms to Herbivory
- **Physical:**
    - Thorns, spines
    - Trichomes
    - "Cage" structure
    - Thick skin; toughness
    - Silica
    - Low nutritional value

- **Chemical:**
    - Primary and secondary metabolites (Ex: phenol, terpenes)
        - Constitutive vs. induced

## Herbivory Summary
- Herbivory affects any part of the plant
- Insects typically prefer a specific plant or a group of plants; mammals appear to be more generalists
- Plants have physical and chemical mechanisms to protect themselves against herbivores
- Population level of herbivores depends on the availability of the host species (plants), and the presence of natural enemies
- Level of plant mortality depends on the ability of plants to recover from defoliation (Ex: age, drainage) and the surrounding environment (Ex: density, non-host species)
- Response to grazing depends on the ability of plants to reproduce and compete
