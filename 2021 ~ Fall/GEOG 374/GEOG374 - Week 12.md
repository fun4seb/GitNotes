# GEOG374 - Week 12: Disturbances (Generalities)
- Disturbances:
    - Generalities of disturbances

# Generalities of Disturbances
- Ecosystems are (often) driven by more than one disturbance agent

- Disturbance agents can interact together
    - Insect + fire
    - Wind + insects
    - Root rot + wind

- Plants have both **physical** and **chemical** defence mechanisms to protect themselves from disturbances
    - Chemical defence mechanisms can either be **constitutive** (natural defence mechanisms) or **induced** (chemically induced upon them such as through insects)
