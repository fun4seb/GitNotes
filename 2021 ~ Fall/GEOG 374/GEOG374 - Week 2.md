# GEOG374 - Week 2

# Plant Clones
- **Ramet** = refers to a single physiological individual produced by clonal propagation; a single "clone"
- **Genet** = refers to a group of ramets that originate from a single seed

# Review: Plant Life Span
- **Annual vs. Biennial vs. Perennial**
    - **Annual = live 1 year**
        - Short life cycle; germination to seed in a single growing season
        - Limited by length of growing season
        - Good colonizers because they produce many seeds; aggressive growers
        - Ex: Wheat, rice
    - **Biennial = live 2 years**
        - Flowing in second year
        - Occur in succession between ruderals (annuals) and perennial plants
        - Ex: Raspberry
    - **Perennial = live several years**
        - Flowering is delayed to a time with good resources and storage
        - Can regrow if cut or dead
        - Ex: Banana tree, trees, shrubs

# Continued: Seed Reproduction Cycle
1. **Sexually mature woody plant**
    - Mature plants are divided by annuals (seeds produced within a growing season), Biennials (seeds produced in their second growing season), and perennials (regrow every season)
        - Chronological vs. physiological age; plants can grow at different rates and the same plant can be at a different stage in its cycle than another due to better or worse conditions, so its helpful to view trees as having "2 ages"
2. **Reproductive buds are formed** 
    - Bud loss can occur through climate (wind, freeze, drought) and predation (insects, bats, etc.); seeds are spread
3. **Flowering pollination**
    - Flowering fruit can become pollinated through climate (wind), predation, and resource availability
        - Some plants may develop flowers with specific colors, or smells to attract predictors to spread their seed
    - Number of fruits increases with plant size and resource availability
    - Fruit loss can occur (thus spreading seeds) through climate and predation

4. **Mature seed**
    - Periodicity in seed production (perennial plants; mast year)
        - Mast year = year with higher than usual production of seeds; frequency varies with climate conditions and species (Ex: every 2-8 years is a mast year)
        - Strategy = satiate seed predators
    - Seed production increases with plant size and resource availability
    - Plants only have a certain amount of energy to expend to produce seeds for reproduction, meaning they may produce many small seeds that spread far (expecting only a few to be successful), or they may produce very few larger seeds that spread close (expecting most to be successful)
5. **Seed dispersal**
    - Seed dispersal is accomplished through wind, animals, gravity (apples), water (coconut), ballistic
    - Primary vs. secondary seed dispersal
        - Primary seed dispersal is when it falls directly from the plant
        - Secondary seed dispersal is when it is carried to its new place through wind, animals, etc.
    - Benefits of seed dispersal:
        - Helps reaching habitats favorable for the development of offspring/colonize new environments
            - Long distance: Less competition with adult plants
            - Short distance: land on adequate site conditions
        - Lowers the impacts of density-dependent seed and seedling predators and pathogens (disease) 
    - Different seeds have a different mortality rate over time compared to total initial seeds produced by the plant (seed survivorship)
6. **Seed bank**
    - Seed bank = seeds remaining available for germination
    - Sources of seeds:
        - Annual seed rain
        - Dormant seed locations
            - Soil surfaces (Ex: forest floor)
                - Dormancy: few days to many years
                - Dormancy seeds are at risk of predation and rotting
            - Tree crown (cones)
7. **Germination**
    - Anatomy of a seed:
        - Seed coat: protects seed from harm
        - Plumule: will become the shoot
        - Hypocotyl: will become the stem
        - Radicle: will become the root
        - Cotyledon: acts as food storage
    - Germination steps:
    - Importance of seedbeds
        - Seedbed = spot where seed falls
        - Seedbed provides moisture and nutrients for the plant to develop; therefor a good seedbed is one which allows for the seed to access adequate moisture and nutrients for growth
            - Is a seedbed covered in fallen leaves beneficial for germination?; No because it blocks sunlight and restricts a fallen seed's access to the soil
    - Comparison of seedbeds
8. **Seeding bank**
9. **Established plant**
    - Grows to sexually mature plant, repeating the cycle

# Earthworms & Forests
- **Impacts of earthworms** = decrease in plant species diversity and community composition by:
    - Predating and ingesting seeds and seedlings of specific species
    - Changing soil characteristics (rise in nutrient cycling, pH, water infiltration; drop in leaf litter)
    - Synergistic effects with other stressors (Ex: deer)

- Impacts of earthworms increases with diversity in earthworm ecological groups (greater disturbance level)

# Vegetative Reproduction
- **Vegetative reproduction** = any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or grows from a specialized reproductive structure

- **Ways in which plants reproduce include:**  
    - Underground organs (tuber, bulb, rhizomes)
    - Root suckers
    - Stolon
    - Layering
    - Sprouts
    - Plantlets
    - Bulbils (above ground bulbs)
    - Clonal fragmentation
    - Seeds

- Some plants can both reproduce sexually and vegetatively
    - Plants produce vegetatively when there are unfavorable conditions

## Summary: Regenerative Strategies of Plants
- Regeneration method:
    - Vegetative = new vegetative shoots remaining attached to parent plant until well established
    - Active seed bank = viable seeds that have no dormancy requirement; reside in seed bank less than a year
    - Dormant/persistent seed bank = viable but dormant seeds present throughout the year; some persisting more than a year
    - Fire-induced opening of clones = heat of fire opens cones where seeds are stored

# Plant Life Cycles
- Plant life cycles include:
    - Growth
    - **Senescence** (old age; sexual maturity)
    - Death

- **Active apical bud & dormant lateral buds** (why plants grow upward)
    - The active apical bud is the location where shoot growth occurs (tip of the stem); The apical bud produces the plant hormone, auxin, that stops growth of the lateral buds further down on the stem, unless the growth of apical bud is impeded causing the dormant lateral buds to activate and take over growth

- **Modular growth of plants:**
    - **Module** = length of stem between two nodes
    - It is beneficial for plants to grow in modular sections because if a higher module dies, a lower module will continue growing

# Functional Ecology
- **Functional ecology** = Role of physiology and traits of plants in their response to the environment

- Helps to answer questions such as...
    - Why are some species found in different light environments while others are only found in open environment?
    - Why are species found in a specific soil conditions while others are more generalists?

## Concept of Niche
- **Fundamental niche** = the range of conditions that a species is physiologically capable of growing in

- Importance of "niche" in environmental assessments
    - Helps to understand how much environmental changes a plant can sustain before the survival of individuals, or the normal development of populations can be affected

# Light Availability
- Uses of light:
    - Allows plants to sense day length; reliable to time physiological events
    - Photosynthesis

- **Acclimations to contrasting light environments:**
    - Photosynthesis
        - The rate of photosynthesis is boosted in shady environments to allow for maximum light to be absorbed; compensating for scarcity in light by increasing rate of photosynthesis 
    - Sunflecks and tree canopy
        - Sunfleck = instances of solar irradiance in which sunlight is able to directly reach the ground
    - Leaves
        - Leaves may change shape to maximize light interception when in shade (leaf shape at top vs. bottom canopy)
