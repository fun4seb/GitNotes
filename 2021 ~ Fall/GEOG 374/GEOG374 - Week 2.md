# GEOG374 - Week 2: Plant Establishment & Reproduction

# Seed Reproduction Cycle
1. **Sexually mature woody plant**
    - Mature plants are divided by annuals (seeds produced within a growing season), Biennials (seeds produced in their second growing season), and perennials (regrow every season)
        - Chronological vs. physiological age; plants can grow at different rates and the same plant can be at a different stage in its cycle than another due to better or worse conditions, so its helpful to view trees as having "2 ages"
2. **Reproductive buds are formed** 
    - Bud loss can occur through climate (wind, freeze, drought) and predation (insects, bats, etc.); seeds are spread
3. **Flowering pollination**
    - Flowering fruit can become pollinated through climate (wind), predation, and resource availability
        - Some plants may develop flowers with specific colors, or smells to attract predictors to spread their seed
    - Number of fruits increases with plant size and resource availability
    - Fruit loss can occur (thus spreading seeds) through climate and predation

4. **Mature seed**
    - Periodicity in seed production (perennial plants; mast year)
        - Mast year = year with higher than usual production of seeds; frequency varies with climate conditions and species (Ex: every 2-8 years is a mast year)
        - Strategy = satiate seed predators
    - Seed production increases with plant size and resource availability
    - Plants only have a certain amount of energy to expend to produce seeds for reproduction, meaning they may produce many small seeds that spread far (expecting only a few to be successful), or they may produce very few larger seeds that spread close (expecting most to be successful)
5. **Seed dispersal**
    - Seed dispersal is accomplished through wind, animals, gravity (apples), water (coconut), ballistic
    - Primary vs. secondary seed dispersal
        - Primary seed dispersal is when it falls directly from the plant
        - Secondary seed dispersal is when it is carried to its new place through wind, animals, etc.
    - Benefits of seed dispersal:
        - Helps reaching habitats favorable for the development of offspring/colonize new environments
            - Long distance: Less competition with adult plants
            - Short distance: land on adequate site conditions
        - Lowers the impacts of density-dependent seed and seedling predators and pathogens (disease) 
    - Different seeds have a different mortality rate over time compared to total initial seeds produced by the plant (seed survivorship)
6. **Seed bank**
    - Seed bank = seeds remaining available for germination
    - Sources of seeds:
        - Annual seed rain
        - Dormant seed locations
            - Soil surfaces (Ex: forest floor)
                - Dormancy: few days to many years
                - Dormancy seeds are at risk of predation and rotting
            - Tree crown (cones)
7. **Germination**
    - Anatomy of a seed:
        - Seed coat: protects seed from harm
        - Plumule: will become the shoot
        - Hypocotyl: will become the stem
        - Radicle: will become the root
        - Cotyledon: acts as food storage
    - Germination steps:
    - Importance of seedbeds
        - Seedbed = spot where seed falls
        - Seedbed provides moisture and nutrients for the plant to develop; therefor a good seedbed is one which allows for the seed to access adequate moisture and nutrients for growth
            - Is a seedbed covered in fallen leaves beneficial for germination?; No because it blocks sunlight and restricts a fallen seed's access to the soil
    - Comparison of seedbeds
8. **Seeding bank**
9. **Established plant**
    - Grows to sexually mature plant, repeating the cycle

# Earthworms & Forests
- **Impacts of earthworms** = decrease in plant species diversity and community composition by:
    - Predating and ingesting seeds and seedlings of specific species
    - Changing soil characteristics (rise in nutrient cycling, pH, water infiltration; drop in leaf litter)
    - Synergistic effects with other stressors (Ex: deer)

- Impacts of earthworms increases with diversity in earthworm ecological groups (greater disturbance level)

# Regenerative Strategies of Plants
- Regeneration methods:
    - **Vegetative** = new vegetative shoots remaining attached to parent plant until well established
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to disturbances and sexual reproduction is unfavorable
    - **Active seed bank** = viable seeds that have no dormancy requirement; reside in seed bank less than a year
        - Advantageous in sites with favorable weather and predictable seasonal disturbances by climate or biotic factors
    - **Dormant/persistent seed bank** = viable but dormant seeds present throughout the year; some persisting more than a year
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to temporally unpredictable disturbances (wait for an opening to germinate)
    - **Fire-induced opening of clones** = heat of fire opens cones where seeds are stored allowing germination immediately following favorable conditions
        - Advantageous when the site is prone to frequent, intense fires
    - **Wind-dispersed seeds** = propagates an abundance of very light seeds that are dispersed over long distances by wind
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to spatially unpredictable disturbance (spread seeds far to ensure success and avoid disturbances close to parent plant)
    - **Locally dispersed seeds** = propagates a few heavy seeds that are dispersed by gravity and animals
        - Advantageous when the site in the vicinity of the parent plant is predictably safe for seedlings
    - **Persistent juveniles** = seedlings capable of long-term persistence in a juvenile state to wait until conditions are favorable or disturbances stop
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to low intensities of disturbances (wait for an opening to mature)

## Vegetative Reproduction
- **Vegetative reproduction** = any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or grows from a specialized reproductive structure

- **Ways in which plants reproduce include:**  
    - Underground organs (tuber, bulb, rhizomes)
    - Root suckers
    - Stolon
    - Layering
    - Sprouts
    - Plantlets
    - Bulbils (above ground bulbs)
    - Clonal fragmentation
    - Seeds

- Some plants can both reproduce sexually and vegetatively
    - Plants produce vegetatively when there are unfavorable conditions

- **Plant Clones:**
    - **Ramet** = refers to a single physiological individual produced by clonal propagation; a single "clone"
    - **Genet** = refers to a group of ramets that originate from a single seed

# Plant Life Cycles
- Plant life cycles include:
    - Growth
    - **Senescence** (old age; sexual maturity)
    - Death

- **Active apical bud & dormant lateral buds** (why plants grow upward)
    - The active apical bud is the location where shoot growth occurs (tip of the stem); The apical bud produces the plant hormone, auxin, that stops growth of the lateral buds further down on the stem, unless the growth of apical bud is impeded causing the dormant lateral buds to activate and take over growth

- **Modular growth of plants:**
    - **Module** = length of stem between two nodes
    - It is beneficial for plants to grow in modular sections because if a higher module dies, a lower module will continue growing
