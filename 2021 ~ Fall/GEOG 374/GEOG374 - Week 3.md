# GEOG374 - Week 3: Functional Ecology (Light and Soil)

# Functional Ecology
- **Functional ecology** = Role of physiology and traits of plants in their response to the environment; study of how plants adapt their function to fit their niche and thrive within an environment

- Helps to answer questions such as...
    - Why are some species found in different light environments while others are only found in open environment?
    - Why are species found in a specific soil conditions while others are more generalists?

## Concept of Niche
- **Fundamental niche** = the range of conditions that a species is physiologically capable of growing in

- Importance of "niche" in environmental assessments
    - Helps to understand how much environmental changes a plant can sustain before the survival of individuals, or the normal development of populations can be affected

# Light Availability
- **Uses of light:**
    - Allows plants to sense day length; reliable to time physiological events
    - Photosynthesis

- **Shade tolerance** = plant's ability to tolerate low light levels; ability to adapt to low light environments to continue growth

- Acclimations to contrasting light environments:
    - **Photosynthesis**
        - The rate of photosynthesis is boosted in shady environments to allow for maximum light to be absorbed; compensating for scarcity in light by increasing rate of photosynthesis 
    - **Sunflecks and tree canopy**
        - Sunfleck = instances of solar irradiance in which sunlight is able to directly reach the ground
        - Caused by opening in the tree canopy (Ex: due to tree death) that allows light to reach the floor
    - **Leaves and needles**
        - Leaves/needles may change shape to maximize light interception when in shade (leaf shape at top vs. bottom canopy); Only shade-tolerant species show such plasticity
            - Leaves/needles can also change their display (direction they are facing) to optimize photosynthesis depending on the angle they receive sunlight (directly above due to opening in canopy vs. every direction in high light environment)
        - Full light pattern = light penetrates deeper into the crown (foliage layers)
    - **Crown architecture**
        - The shape of the crown may change to optimize light capture in each light environment (Ex: growing a wider "umbrella-like" crown to capture the most amount of light seeping through the canopy in low light environments); Only shade-tolerant species show such plasticity
    - **Growth allocation**
        - In full light environment > allocation to all parts (trees)
        - In low light environment:
            - Shade intolerant species keep growing in height
            - Shade tolerant virtually stop growth, except to foliage (sit and wait strategy)

- **Impact of tree size on light requirements**
    - The bigger a tree, the most light it requires to accomplish all its energy intensive tasks and grow (leaf respiration > leaf construction > construction of stem and roots)

- **Shade tolerance vs. intolerance**
    - **Shade tolerance** = plant's ability to tolerate low light levels; ability to adapt to low light environments to continue growth
    - Trees that are more **shade tolerant**, can thrive in lower light environments because it can tolerate having less access to light to still grow; trees that are more **shade intolerant** can only thrive in high light environments because it cannot tolerate not having access to light

- **Light availability in summary:**
    - Plants can be subjected to variable light environments
    - Some species evolved to acclimate their physiology (more efficient), their growth pattern, and their shape (improve light capture) to occupy distinct niches
        - **Specialists vs. generalists** (plasticity in their physiology and architecture) 

# Concepts of Soil Science
- **Soil** = the top layer of the Earth's surface consisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with decayed organic matter
    - Classified based on **size**; clay (0.002mm), silt (0.05mm - 0.002mm), sand (2.00mm - 0.05mm)

- **Horizon** = boundary between two distinct layers of soil

- Creation of soil:
    - **Mechanical weathering** = the process of rock breakage without any chemical alteration into smaller sediment (freeze and thaw cycles, temperature change, glacial movement)
    - **Chemical weathering** = process of actual decomposition and decay of the constituent minerals in rock due to chemical reaction (water dilution, chemical reactions, organic acids)

**Humus** = organic layer of topsoil in which decomposition of dead plant and animal matter transfers nutrients into the soil
    - Layers of humus: litter (surface layer; debris like leaves), fibric, humic (lowest layer; very fine particles)

- **Humus forms:**
    - Mor
        - Abrupt boundary between mineral and organic layer
        - Decomposition mostly from bacteria and fungi (slow)
    - Moder
        - Gradual boundary between mineral and organic layer
        - Moderate activity of soil fauna
    - Mull
        - Organic-enriched mineral soil horizon present (brown soil)
        - F and H horizons thin or absent

- **Concepts of soil in summary:**
    - Soils are the results of mechanical and chemical processes
    - They are composed of mineral and organic material
    - Classified based on size; clay (0.002mm), silt (0.05mm - 0.002mm), sand (2.00mm - 0.05mm)
    - Time and local conditions lead to different types of soil (Ex: podzol) and humus (Ex: mull)
        - It is possible to infer soil richness from the type of soil and humus we observe
