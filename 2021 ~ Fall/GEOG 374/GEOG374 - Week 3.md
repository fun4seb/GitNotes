# GEOG374 - Week 3

# Review: Regenerative Strategies of Plants
- Regeneration methods:
    - **Vegetative** = new vegetative shoots remaining attached to parent plant until well established
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to disturbances and sexual reproduction is unfavorable
    - **Active seed bank** = viable seeds that have no dormancy requirement; reside in seed bank less than a year
        - Advantageous in sites with favorable weather and predictable seasonal disturbances by climate or biotic factors
    - **Dormant/persistent seed bank** = viable but dormant seeds present throughout the year; some persisting more than a year
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to temporally unpredictable disturbances (wait for an opening to germinate)
    - **Fire-induced opening of clones** = heat of fire opens cones where seeds are stored allowing germination immediately following favorable conditions
        - Advantageous when the site is prone to frequent, intense fires
    - **Wind-dispersed seeds** = propagates an abundance of very light seeds that are dispersed over long distances by wind
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to spatially unpredictable disturbance (spread seeds far to ensure success and avoid disturbances close to parent plant)
    - **Locally dispersed seeds** = propagates a few heavy seeds that are dispersed by gravity and animals
        - Advantageous when the site in the vicinity of the parent plant is predictably safe for seedlings
    - **Persistent juveniles** = seedlings capable of long-term persistence in a juvenile state to wait until conditions are favorable or disturbances stop
        - Advantageous when the site is subject to low intensities of disturbances (wait for an opening to mature)

# Review: Concept of Niche
- **Fundamental niche** = the range of conditions that a species is physiologically capable of growing in

- Importance of "niche" in environmental assessments
    - Helps to understand how much environmental changes a plant can sustain before the survival of individuals, or the normal development of populations can be affected

# Review: Light Availability
- **Uses of light:**
    - Allows plants to sense day length; reliable to time physiological events
    - Photosynthesis

- Acclimations to contrasting light environments:
    - **Photosynthesis**
        - The rate of photosynthesis is boosted in shady environments to allow for maximum light to be absorbed; compensating for scarcity in light by increasing rate of photosynthesis 
    - **Sunflecks and tree canopy**
        - Sunfleck = instances of solar irradiance in which sunlight is able to directly reach the ground
        - Caused by opening in the tree canopy (Ex: due to tree death) that allows light to reach the floor
    - **Leaves and needles**
        - Leaves/needles may change shape to maximize light interception when in shade (leaf shape at top vs. bottom canopy); Only shade-tolerant species show such plasticity
            - Leaves/needles can also change their display (direction they are facing) to optimize photosynthesis depending on the angle they receive sunlight (directly above due to opening in canopy vs. every direction in high light environment)
        - Full light pattern = light penetrates deeper into the crown (foliage layers)
    - **Crown architecture**
        - The shape of the crown may change to optimize light capture in each light environment (Ex: growing a wider "umbrella-like" crown to capture the most amount of light seeping through the canopy in low light environments); Only shade-tolerant species show such plasticity
    - **Growth allocation**
        - In full light environment > allocation to all parts (trees)
        - In low light environment:
            - Shade intolerant species keep growing in height
            - Shade tolerant virtually stop growth, except to foliage (sit and wait strategy)

- **Impact of tree size on light requirements**
    - The bigger a tree, the most light it requires to accomplish all its energy intensive tasks and grow (leaf respiration > leaf construction > construction of stem and roots)

- **Shade tolerance vs. intolerance**
    - **Shade tolerance** = plant's ability to tolerate low light levels; ability to adapt to low light environments to continue growth
    - Trees that are more **shade tolerant**, can thrive in lower light environments because it can tolerate having less access to light to still grow; trees that are more **shade intolerant** can only thrive in high light environments because it cannot tolerate not having access to light

- **Light availability in summary:**
    - Plants can be subjected to variable light environments
    - Some species evolved to acclimate their physiology (more efficient), their growth pattern, and their shape (improve light capture) to occupy distinct niches
        - **Specialists vs. generalists** (plasticity in their physiology and architecture) 

# Concepts of Soil Science
- **Soil** = the top layer of the Earth's surface consisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with decayed organic matter
    - Classified based on size; clay (0.002mm), silt (0.05mm - 0.002mm), sand (2.00mm - 0.05mm)

- **Horizon** = 

- Creation of soil:
    - **Mechanical weathering** = the process of rock breakage without any chemical alteration into smaller sediment (freeze and thaw cycles, temperature change, glacial movement)
    - **Chemical weathering** = process of actual decomposition and decay of the constituent minerals in rock due to chemical reaction (water dilution, chemical reactions, organic acids)

- Evolution of Soil:

**Humus** = organic layer of topsoil in which decomposition of dead plant and animal matter transfers nutrients into the soil
    - Layers of humus: litter (surface layer; debris like leaves), fibric, humic (lowest layer; very fine particles)

- Humus forms:
    - Mor
        - Abrupt boundary between mineral and organic layer
        - Decomposition mostly from bacteria and fungi (slow)
    - Moder
        - Gradual boundary between mineral and organic layer
        - Moderate activity of soil fauna
    - Mull
        - Organic-enriched mineral soil horizon present (brown soil)
        - F and H horizons thin or absent

- **Concepts of soil in summary:**
    - Soils are the results of mechanical and chemical processes
    - They are composed of mineral and organic material
    - Classified based on size; clay (0.002mm), silt (0.05mm - 0.002mm), sand (2.00mm - 0.05mm)
    - Time and local conditions lead to different types of soil (Ex: podzol) and humus (Ex: mull)
        - It is possible to infer soil richness from the type of soil and humus we observe

# Soil and Water Availability
- **Where is the water in the soil?**
    - Water in the soil is retained in the spaces between the soil particles

- **Finer soils (clay) retains more water compared to coarser soils (sand)** because there is less space (void) between the soil particles for water to drain out

- Levels of water saturation in soil:
    - **Saturation** = pores (spaces between soil particles) are completely full of water (Ex: after rain)
    - **Field capacity** = some water left in the soil available to plants after the gravitational water is drained out
    - **Wilting point** = point where a plant can no longer withdraw withdraw water; no more water is available to plants

- **How do plants capture and transport water?**
    - Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots, it is then transported up the stem and distributed through the leaf veins
    - Three modes on absorption: **osmosis, capillarity, and difference in water potential**
    - Water potential varies with temperature and air humidity
    - Closing stomata at higher water deficit allows higher pressure
        - **Stomata** = pores found in the epidermis of leaves, stems, and other organs, that controls the rate of gas exchange (CO2 entering the plant and water vapor exiting)

## Droughts
- Droughts can be brief or prolonged, mild or extreme, unpredictable or regular
    - Plant adaptations to deal with drought include **drought tolerance**, and **drought avoidance**

- **How do plants react to water stress?**
    - **Low water stress:**
        - Decrease in overall growth while diverting energy to root growth to reach more water
    - **High water stress:**
        - Leaf wilting
        - Closing of stomata when reaching a critical water stress (stops water from escaping the plant)
        - Use of stored carbohydrates
        - Loss of foliage and branches
        - Plant mortality (death; extreme)
    - **Recovery** from cavitation once water availability is adequate
        - New conducting tissues (wood)
        - “Recovery” of existing conducting tissues (root pressure)
        - Cavitation fatigue
