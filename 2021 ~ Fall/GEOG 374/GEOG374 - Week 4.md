# GEOG374 - Week 4: Water & Nutrients

# Review: Soil and Water Availability
- **Where is the water in the soil?**
    - Water in the soil is retained in the spaces between the soil particles

- **Finer soils (clay) retains more water compared to coarser soils (sand)** because there is less space (void) between the soil particles for water to drain out

- Levels of water saturation in soil:
    - **Saturation** = pores (spaces between soil particles) are completely full of water (Ex: after rain)
    - **Field capacity** = some water left in the soil available to plants after the gravitational water is drained out
    - **Wilting point** = point where a plant can no longer withdraw withdraw water; no more water is available to plants

- **How do plants capture and transport water?**
    - Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots, it is then transported up the stem and distributed through the leaf veins
    - Three modes on absorption: **osmosis, capillarity, and difference in water potential**
    - Water potential varies with temperature and air humidity
    - Closing stomata at higher water deficit allows higher pressure
        - **Stomata** = pores found in the epidermis of leaves, stems, and other organs, that controls the rate of gas exchange (CO2 entering the plant and water vapor exiting)

## Review: Droughts
- Droughts can be brief or prolonged, mild or extreme, unpredictable or regular
    - Plant adaptations to deal with drought include **drought tolerance**, and **drought avoidance**

- **How do plants react to water stress?**
    - **Low water stress:**
        - Decrease in overall growth while diverting energy to root growth to reach more water
    - **High water stress:**
        - Leaf wilting
        - Closing of stomata when reaching a critical water stress (stops water from escaping the plant)
        - Use of stored carbohydrates
        - Loss of foliage and branches
        - Plant mortality (death; extreme)
    - **Recovery** from cavitation (dry conditions) once water availability is adequate
        - New conducting tissues (wood)
        - “Recovery” of existing conducting tissues (root pressure)
        - Cavitation fatigue (decrease in capacity to transport water through usual transportation routes)

## Plant Adaptations to Low Water Availability
- **Two strategies:** drought tolerance (conservative) vs. drought avoidance (opportunistic)
    - **Conservative:**
        - Denser and coarser root system
        - High water conservation, slow growth over longer period
        - Sit and wait strategy
        - Rely on deeper soil water
    - **Opportunistic:**
        - Rapid root growth using low-density fine roots
        - Low water conservation, higher growth over a shorter period after a rain event
        - Rely on shallow soil water
        - Lower survival time during a prolonged drought

- **Drought tolerance strategies:**
    - Adapted photosynthesis machinery (Ex: C3 vs. C4 Vs. CAM plants; Crassulacean Acid Metabolism)
    - Close stomata at higher hydric stress > withdraw water at higher pressure (-1.5 Mpa vs. -8 Mpa); remember stomata regulate the exhalation of oxygen and water vapor so by closing the stomata you are retaining water that would have otherwise escaped
    - Change the number, size, arrangement, and behavior of stomata
    - Develop a thicker leaf cuticle (Ex: succulents and cacti; thick leaves holds water)
    - Decrease leaf area (loss of water is through the leaves)
    - Greater sapwood area (area where water flows through wood and creates sap)
    - More efficient xylem (for flow, cavitation, and recovery)
    - Grow a shallow or deep root system (if you have a root system on the surface you can capture rain water more rapidly but if there is competition you can also grow deeper to reach water not accessible to others)
    - Larger root system (to seek and capture more water underground)
    - Better capture of air moisture (will not need to rely on roots as much)
    - Water storage (Ex: stem, roots)
    - Withdraw water at higher pressure (-1.5 Mpa vs -6 Mpa)

- **Drought avoidance strategies:**
    - Establish/grow when water is available (Ex: desert annuals)
    - Establish/grow in the wettest places (Ex: oasis)
    - Become dormant (Ex: grass)
    - Fail to establish at all until water is available (Ex: trees in the prairies)

- **Plant adaptations to high water availability:**
    - Tolerance (duration is species specific)
    - Anaerobic energy production
    - Air channel
    - Aerial/above ground roots (Ex: mangrove trees)

- **Soil and water availability summary:**
    - Soil texture determine the capacity of soils to hold water (clay > sand)
    - Plant avoid or tolerate environments at unfavorable water availability
    - Tolerance mechanisms involve changes in physiology (Ex: CAM photosynthesis), the anatomy of plants (smaller leaves, air channel) and growth pattern/timing

# Nutrient Availability
- **What are those nutrients?**
    - Macro-nutrients (**N**, **P**, K, S, Mg, Ca); most important is nitrogen and phosphorus
    - Micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Bo, Mo, Cu, Zn, Cl, Co)

- **Where are those nutrients?**
    - Clay has more surface area to capture nutrient ions

- **Liebig’s law of minimum** = “The yield of a plant is limited by a deficiency of any one essential element, even though all others are present in adequate amounts”

- **Role of soil pH:**
    - Determines the distribution of plants
        - Acidic soils > conifers, ericaceae
        - Alkaline soils > grasses
    - lower pH (more acid) = higher H+ and Al+++ ions
     - H+ and Al+++ ions have a better ability to bind
        - Dislodge nutrients required by plants
    - **pH determines the availability of nutrients in the soil**; different pH ranges (from strongly acid to strongly alkaline) have different availability of certain nutrients, Ex: Copper and zinc, magnesium, and iron occur more abundantly in acidic environments

## Acclimations of plants to lower nutrient availability
- Greater allocation to roots (relative); Ex: more roots looking for nitrogen in the soil
    - Modification of **root architecture**; creating a "web" to better capture nutrients in nutrient-rich environments
- **Internal processes:**
    - **Translocation** within the plant (the movement of materials from leaves to other tissues throughout the plant)
    - Storage (plants can store excess nutrients in tissues like fat cells)

- **Alternative ways to capture nutrients:**
    - Symbolic association with **mycorrhizae**
        - Extend the surface area of the root system
        - Mycorrhizae can capture nutrients that plant roots cannot (mycorrhizae can excrete chemicals into the soil)
        - Key success for:
            - Growth in poor soils
            - Colonization of barre soils
        - Association is selective
    - Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (Ex: Legumes, shrubs)
        - Decomposition releases fixed nitrogen into the ecosystem

- **Alternative sources of nutrients:**
    - Insectivory (20-80% of plant nitrogen); eating insects Ex: Venus fly traps

- Nutrients availability **directly affects plant growth**
    - Deficiency in nutrients (too few nutrients) or toxicity (too many nutrients) can lead to less optimal growth, require the **optimum concentration** of nutrients

## Nutrients Summary
- Soil texture determine the capacity of soils to hold nutrients (clay > sand)
- Soil pH plays a key role in availability of nutrients
- Acclimation mechanisms involve:
    - Physiological processes (e.g., translocation of nutrients)
    - Growth strategies (root length and architecture)
    - Facultative association with other organisms (Ex: mycorrhizae)
- There are optimal levels of essential nutrients and tolerance to other minerals

# Temperature
- **Question:** What are factors affecting temperature in natural environments?
    - Humidity
    - Insolation (light from the sun)
    - Topography (shady vs. sunny areas)
    - Proximity of large body of water
    - Location on the globe (north vs. south)
    - Altitude
    - Wind
    - Time of year

- **Role of temperature on biome distribution**
    - Temperature/precipitation graph
        - Ex: low precipitation + high temperature = desert, but low precipitation + low temperature = tundra)
        - Ex: moderate precipitation + moderate temperature = temperate forest

- **Response of plants to ambient temperature**

- Impacts of high temperatures (35°C – 40°C for mesophilic plants):
    - **Physical** heat leads to: membrane damage (viscosity, leakage) > Osmotic breakdown > Wilting, drying > **heat death**
    - **Biochemical** heat leads to: protein/enzyme inactivation > protein denaturation > **heat death**    

- Tolerance adaptations to **high temperatures:**
    - **Morphological** adaptations:
        - Insulation by hairs
        - Reflection by hairs
        - Transpiration cooling
        - Dissection of leaf lamina
        - Vertical leaf position
        - Leads to **head avoidance** which = **heat survival** 
    - **Biochemical** adaptations:
        - Chemical chaperones
        - Lipid composition of bio-membranes (higher viscosity)
        - Heat shock proteins
        - Leads to **acquired thermotolerance** which = **heat survival**

- Tolerance adaptations to **low temperatures (frost survival):**
    - **Prevention of freezing:**
        - Insulation
        - Spatial frost exclusion (life forms)
        - Temporal frost exclusion (seasonal timing)
    - **Survival of freezing events:**
        - Freezing avoidance:
            - Persistent super-cooling
            - Freezing point depression
            - Extraorgan freezing and translocated freezing in tissue spaces
        - Freezing tolerance:
            - Tolerance to cell shrinkage
            - Tolerance to freezing dehydration
            - Hardening of woody tissues
    - **Survival of secondary effects of frost:**
        - Protection against photo-inhibition during winter
        - Protection against winter drought
        - Tolerance to hypoxia under ice sheets and compressed snow
        - Resistance to mechanical strain caused by frost, ice, snow load, and snow pressure

## Temperature Summary
- Temperature is involved in the acclimation to stresses and developmental processes
- Plants have biochemical and morphological adaptations to temperature (cold and hot)
- Minimum, optimal and maximum temperature vary with local climate and acclimation level
