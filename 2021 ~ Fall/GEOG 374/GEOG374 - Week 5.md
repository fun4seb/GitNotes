# GEOG374 - Week 5: Functional Ecology (Temperature)

# Temperature
- **Question:** What are factors affecting temperature in natural environments?
    - Humidity
    - Insolation (light from the sun)
    - Topography (shady vs. sunny areas)
    - Proximity of large body of water
    - Location on the globe (north vs. south)
    - Altitude
    - Wind
    - Time of year

- **Role of temperature on biome distribution**
    - Temperature/precipitation graph
        - Ex: low precipitation + high temperature = desert, but low precipitation + low temperature = tundra)
        - Ex: moderate precipitation + moderate temperature = temperate forest

- **Response of plants to ambient temperature**

- Impacts of high temperatures (35°C – 40°C) on mesophilic plants:
    - **Physical** impacts on a plant: membrane damage (viscosity, leakage) > Osmotic breakdown > Wilting/drying of tissues > **heat death**
    - **Biochemical** impact on a plant: protein/enzyme inactivation > protein denaturation > **heat death**    

## Tolerance adaptations to high temperatures
- **Morphological** adaptations:
    - Insulation by hairs; insulate tissues against high temperature by becoming more "hairy"/fuzzy on the surface of the plant
    - Reflection by hairs; reflect heat by making leaves lighter in color through growing this hair/fuzz
    - Transpiration cooling
    - Dissection of leaf lamina
    - Vertical leaf position
    - Leads to **head avoidance** which = **heat survival** 

- **Biochemical** adaptations:
    - Chemical chaperones
    - Lipid composition of bio-membranes (higher viscosity)
    - Heat shock proteins
    - Leads to **acquired thermotolerance** which = **heat survival**

## Tolerance adaptations to low temperatures (frost survival)
- Frost Survival is accomplished through...    
    - **Prevention of freezing:**
        - Insulation (Ex: grow under the snow cover)
        - Spatial frost exclusion (life forms)
        - Temporal frost exclusion (seasonal timing)
    - **Survival against freezing events:**
        - **Freezing avoidance:**
            - Persistent super-cooling
            - Freezing point depression
            - Extraorgan freezing and translocated freezing in tissue spaces
        - **Freezing tolerance:**
            - Tolerance to cell shrinkage
            - Tolerance to freezing dehydration
            - Hardening of woody tissues
    - **Survival against secondary effects of frost:**
        - Protection against photo-inhibition during winter
        - Protection against winter drought
        - Tolerance to hypoxia (absence of oxygen) under ice sheets and compressed snow
        - Resistance to mechanical strain caused by weight of frost, ice, snow load, and snow pressure

## Temperature Extremes of Plants in Different Environments
- **Tropical habitats**
    - Trees: threshold for cold damage = +5 to -2; threshold for heat damage is 45 to 55
    - Alpine plants: threshold for cold damage = -5 to -15; threshold for heat damage = about 45

- **Temperate habitats**
    - Deciduous trees and shrubs: threshold for cold damage = -25 to -35; threshold for heat damage = about 50
    - Herbaceous species: threshold for cold damage = -10 to -20; threshold for heat damage = 40 to 50
    - Grassland species (grasses and sedges): below -30; threshold for heat damage = 60 to 65

- **Habitats with cold winters**
    - Evergreen conifers: threshold for cold damage = -40 to -90; threshold for heat damage is 44 to 50
    - Boreal deciduous trees: threshold for cold damage = below -30; threshold for heat damage is 42 to 45
    - Herbaceous alpine and Arctic species: threshold for cold damage = below -30; threshold for heat damage is 44 to 54

## Temperature Summary
- Temperature is involved in triggering the acclimation to stresses and developmental processes
- Plants have biochemical and morphological adaptations to temperature (cold and hot)
- Minimum, optimal and maximum temperature vary with local climate and acclimation level
