# GEOG374 - Week 6: Life History
- **Terraforming of Mars case study:** Identify the characteristics of the plant used for terraforming (Ideally, these characteristics must be found in one plant species)
    - **Growing conditions on Mars:**
        - Cold (average temperature is -64 C)
        - Year length: 687 days
        - Dry
        - Windy
        - Weak magnetic field (unable to reflect UV)
        - Decomposers (Ex: worms, fungi) are brought from Earth
    - **Characteristics of a plant used for terraforming:**
        - Plant can grow in cold climate (plant that grows at high altitude and latitude)
        - Resistant to wind
        - Root system at the surface of the ground to cope better to drought due to high winds
        - Root system that limits soil erosion by wind
        - Pollination by wind
        - Produce a large amount of seeds (small seeds) to increase the probability of having offspring
        - Medium size seeds to favor dispersal and establishment success
        - Ability to reproduce vegetatively
        - Able to grow in iron rich soil
        - Opportunistic plant that can grow in a stressful environment
        - Resistant to UV light
        - Alternate forms of nutrient capture (Ex: bacteria and nitrogen)
        - Fast life cycle to build-up organic soil (annual plants)
        - High rate of photosynthesis to produce a large amount of oxygen
        - Must be able to grow in dense colonies (build up organic matter)
        - **Plant form:**
            - Algae (but very cold throughout the year)
            - Cold tolerant lichen
        - **Strategy over time:**
            - Short term: grow smaller plants that form rapidly large populations
            - Long term: grow larger plants that produce more oxygen
    - **Trade-offs of plants for terraforming Mars:**
        - Seed size vs. the number of seeds
        - Seed size vs. dispersal distance
        - Seed size vs. establishment success
        - Sexual maturity age vs. the number of seeds
        - Plant size vs. growing environment
        - Seed production frequency vs. lifespan

# Life History Strategies
> Life History Strategies ~ a plant’s schedule of birth, growth reproduction and mortality

- **Life history strategies vary with:**
    - The factors internal to a plant
    - External factors (resource availability, seasonality)
    - The interactions between plants and external factors
    
- Life history strategy determines the **success of organisms in their environment**

## Trade-offs
- Variation in life history is involved with **trade-offs**

- Not every plant can do everything we want; some plants have **trade-offs**
    - Some plants may need to sacrifice effectivity in some areas (Ex: low wood density) in order to excel in other areas (Ex: opportunistic fast growth)

- **Trade-offs are determined by:**
    - Prioritization in the use of resources (Ex: allocating resources to growth or reproduction)
    - Internal constraints in resource scarcity:
        - Quick growth ≠ dense wood; cannot grow quickly AND have dense wood because there is not enough carbohydrates to go around
            - (Fast growing) Aspen density: 420 kg/m3
            - (Slow growing) Maple density: 620-750 kg/m3
        - Allocation of carbohydrates to reproduction vs. growth (annuals vs. perennial plants)
    - Short term vs. long term survival
    
## r-Species & K-Species
- **r-species vs. K-species:**
    - r-species: emphasize high growth rates, produce many offspring
    - K-species: strong competitors that invest more heavily in fewer offspring

- **r-selection:**
    - **Climate:** variable and/or unpredictable; uncertain
    - **Mortality:** often catastrophic; density independent
    - **Population size:** variable; usually well below carrying capacity, frequent recolonization
    - **Intra/interspecific competition:** variable; often minor
    - **Traits favored by r-species:** rapid development, high growth rate, early reproduction, single reproduction
    - **Life span:** relatively short

- **K-selection:**
    - **Climate:** fairly constant and/or predictable; more certain
    - **Mortality:** density dependent
    - **Population size:** fairly constant; at or near carrying capacity, no recolonization required
    - **Intra/interspecific competition:** usually severe
    - **Traits favored by K-species:** slower development, competitive ability, delayed reproduction, repeated reproductions (reproduce seeds every year)
    - **Life span:** longer

- No consistent relationship between r-species or K-species and the amount of plants that produce many seeds often, however most species that produce few seeds infrequently are usually K-species
    - This is because the classification scheme of r and K species is **relative** determining on the scale of species measuring (Ex: a certain tree may be a K-species compared to weeds, but also considered a r-species when relating it to all trees)

## Factors Limiting Biomass (Stress & Distrubance)
- Two factors limiting plant biomass:
    1. **Stress**
        - Conditions that restrict growth (Ex: shortages of light, water, or mineral nutrients and sub-optimal temperature)
    2. **Disturbance**
        - Partial or total destruction of the plant biomass (Ex: herbivores, wind damage, frosts)

- **Disturbance-stress matrix:**
    - Low disturbance and low stress: competitive environment
    - Low disturbance and high stress: stress tolerant
    - High disturbance and low stress: ruderal
    - High disturbance and high stress: no viable strategy

- **Ruderal** = plant growing on waste ground or among refuse; species first to colonize **disturbed lands**

- Three viable growing conditions can be associated with a distinct strategy:
    - **Competitive strategies:**
        - High dense canopy of leaves; extensive lateral spread above and below ground
        - Small allocation of energy towards seed production
        - Max potential growth rate = rapid
    - **Stress tolerant strategies:**
        - Max potential growth rate = slow
        - Longevity in leaves = long
        - Small allocation of energy towards seed production
    - **Ruderal strategies:**
        - Max potential growth rate = rapid
        - Large allocation of energy towards seed production

## C-S-R Model
- **C-S-R model** = competitive, stress tolerant, ruderal model

- Triangle matrix of: **competition, stress, disturbance**
    - Unit: % (maximum value)
    - % = importance in selection of species
