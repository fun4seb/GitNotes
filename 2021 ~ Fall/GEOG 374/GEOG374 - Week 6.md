# GEOG374 - Week 6: Life History Strategies & Competition
- **Terraforming of Mars case study:** Identify the characteristics of the plant used for terraforming (Ideally, these characteristics must be found in one plant species)
    - **Growing conditions on Mars:**
        - Cold (average temperature is -64 C)
        - Year length: 687 days
        - Dry
        - Windy
        - Weak magnetic field (unable to reflect UV)
        - Decomposers (Ex: worms, fungi) are brought from Earth
    - **Characteristics of a plant used for terraforming:**
        - Plant can grow in cold climate (plant that grows at high altitude and latitude)
        - Resistant to wind
        - Root system at the surface of the ground to cope better to drought due to high winds
        - Root system that limits soil erosion by wind
        - Pollination by wind
        - Produce a large amount of seeds (small seeds) to increase the probability of having offspring
        - Medium size seeds to favor dispersal and establishment success
        - Ability to reproduce vegetatively
        - Able to grow in iron rich soil
        - Opportunistic plant that can grow in a stressful environment
        - Resistant to UV light
        - Alternate forms of nutrient capture (Ex: bacteria and nitrogen)
        - Fast life cycle to build-up organic soil (annual plants)
        - High rate of photosynthesis to produce a large amount of oxygen
        - Must be able to grow in dense colonies (build up organic matter)
        - **Plant form:**
            - Algae (but very cold throughout the year)
            - Cold tolerant lichen
        - **Strategy over time:**
            - Short term: grow smaller plants that form rapidly large populations
            - Long term: grow larger plants that produce more oxygen
    - **Trade-offs of plants for terraforming Mars:**
        - Seed size vs. the number of seeds
        - Seed size vs. dispersal distance
        - Seed size vs. establishment success
        - Sexual maturity age vs. the number of seeds
        - Plant size vs. growing environment
        - Seed production frequency vs. lifespan

# Life History Strategies
> Life History Strategies ~ a plant’s schedule of birth, growth reproduction and mortality

- **Life history strategies vary with:**
    - The factors internal to a plant
    - External factors (resource availability, seasonality)
    - The interactions between plants and external factors
    
- Life history strategy determines the **success of organisms in their environment**

## Trade-offs
- Variation in life history is involved with **trade-offs**

- Not every plant can do everything we want; some plants have **trade-offs**
    - Some plants may need to sacrifice effectivity in some areas (Ex: low wood density) in order to excel in other areas (Ex: opportunistic fast growth)

- **Trade-offs are determined by:**
    - Prioritization in the use of resources (Ex: allocating resources to growth or reproduction)
    - Internal constraints in resource scarcity:
        - Quick growth ≠ dense wood; cannot grow quickly AND have dense wood because there is not enough carbohydrates to go around
            - (Fast growing) Aspen density: 420 kg/m3
            - (Slow growing) Maple density: 620-750 kg/m3
        - Allocation of carbohydrates to reproduction vs. growth (annuals vs. perennial plants)
    - Short term vs. long term survival
    
## r-Species & K-Species
- **r-species vs. K-species:**
    - r-species: emphasize high growth rates, produce many offspring
    - K-species: strong competitors that invest more heavily in fewer offspring

- **r-selection:**
    - **Climate:** variable and/or unpredictable; uncertain
    - **Mortality:** often catastrophic; density independent
    - **Population size:** variable; usually well below carrying capacity, frequent recolonization
    - **Intra/interspecific competition:** variable; often minor
    - **Traits favored by r-species:** rapid development, high growth rate, early reproduction, single reproduction
    - **Life span:** relatively short

- **K-selection:**
    - **Climate:** fairly constant and/or predictable; more certain
    - **Mortality:** density dependent
    - **Population size:** fairly constant; at or near carrying capacity, no recolonization required
    - **Intra/interspecific competition:** usually severe
    - **Traits favored by K-species:** slower development, competitive ability, delayed reproduction, repeated reproductions (reproduce seeds every year)
    - **Life span:** longer

- No consistent relationship between r-species or K-species and the amount of plants that produce many seeds often, however most species that produce few seeds infrequently are usually K-species
    - This is because the classification scheme of r and K species is **relative** determining on the scale of species measuring (Ex: a certain tree may be a K-species compared to weeds, but also considered a r-species when relating it to all trees)

## Factors Limiting Biomass (Stress & Disturbance)
- Two factors limiting plant biomass:
    1. **Stress**
        - Conditions that restrict growth (Ex: shortages of light, water, or mineral nutrients and sub-optimal temperature)
    2. **Disturbance**
        - Partial or total destruction of the plant biomass (Ex: herbivores, wind damage, frosts)

- **Disturbance-stress matrix:**
    - Low disturbance and low stress: competitive environment
    - Low disturbance and high stress: stress tolerant
    - High disturbance and low stress: ruderal
    - High disturbance and high stress: no viable strategy

- **Ruderal** = plant growing on waste ground or among refuse; species first to colonize **disturbed lands**

- Three viable growing conditions can be associated with a distinct strategy:
    - **Competitive strategies:**
        - High dense canopy of leaves; extensive lateral spread above and below ground
        - Small allocation of energy towards seed production
        - Max potential growth rate = rapid
    - **Stress tolerant strategies:**
        - Max potential growth rate = slow
        - Longevity in leaves = long
        - Small allocation of energy towards seed production
    - **Ruderal strategies:**
        - Max potential growth rate = rapid
        - Large allocation of energy towards seed production

## C-S-R Model
- **C-S-R model** = competitive, stress tolerant, ruderal model

- Triangle matrix of: **competition, stress, disturbance**
    - Unit: % (maximum value)
    - % = importance in selection of species
        - Competition important at 25%
        - Stress important at 75%
        - Disturbance important at 0%

## Life History Strategies Summary
- Life history strategies determine the success of organisms in their environment
- Involves **trade-offs** between where and how to allocate resources (e.g., physiology, growth, architecture, reproduction)

- **Ways of classifying life history strategies:**
    - r-species and K-species
    - CSR model (competition, stress and ruderal)

# Plant Interactions
- **Plant interactions between 2 species:**
    - **Competition** = negative interaction between both species (they are competing with each other)
    - **Amensalism** = neutral interaction for one species, but negative for the other
    - **Neutralism** = neutral interaction between both species
    - **Allelopathy parasitism** = positive interaction for one species (the parasite), but negative for the other
    - **Commensalism (facilitation)** = neutral interaction for one species, but positive for the other
    - **Mutualism** = positive interaction between both species

# Competition
- **Competition** = an interaction between individuals, brought about by a shared requirement for a resource in limited supply, and leading to a **reduction** in the **survivorship, growth and/or reproduction** of the competing individuals concerned

- **Evaluating the impacts of competition (Grime vs. Tilman):**
    - Scale
        - Grime: individual
        - Tilman: population
    - Measure of success
        - Grime: large size
        - Tilman: dominance
    - Why successful?
        - Grime: capture + resources
        - Tilman: less demanding
    - Time scale
        - Grime: short term
        - Tilman: long term

- **Impact of growing conditions on competitive hierarchy:**
    - The growing conditions of an area have no consistent impact on the competitive hierarchy of species
    - There are other factors involved in the dominance of a species in an ecosystem

- **Impact of growing conditions on the evolution of competition:**
    - While growing conditions may not impact the final outcome of competition between species (who thrives or fails), it does affect the speed in which competition plays out between plants
    - **Competition increases more rapidly over time under favorable conditions**; good growing conditions allow competition to run its course more swiftly

- **Type of competition:**
    - Intraspecific and interspecific
    - Symmetric (same regardless of plant size)
    - **Asymmetric** (varies with plant size, Ex: light)
        - Competitive success > greater resource capture > faster growth > larger size > greater resource capture **(feedback loop)**
        - Why is asymmetric competition favored?
            - Higher resource availability
            - Higher resource capture (Ex: through mycorrhizae)
            - Earlier germination
            - Genes favor faster growth rates (leading to better resource capture/competitive advantage)

- **Impacts of the type of competition on composition of communities:**
    - **Symmetric competition** ("very similar") > **coexistence**
        - Composition of community: balance between similar sized plants
    - **Asymmetric competition** ("dissimilar") > **exclusion**
        - Composition of community: domination of larger plants over smaller ones
    - **Niche differentiation** ("very different") > **coexistence**
        - Composition of community: coexistence of many species that each fill a specific niche within the area and do not interfere in success of other species (as each species is so different in its function/strategies)

- **Impacts of competition on individual plants:**
    - The amount of competition in an area impacts how the plant allocates its energy for growth to achieve the best results
    - Plants situated in areas with a high density of competition allocate **less energy towards reproduction**, and **more energy towards stem and root growth** (to better capture resources and gain a competitive advantage)

- **Description of populations:**
    - Stand = 
    - Even-aged vs. uneven-aged stand = 
    - Balanced vs. unbalanced stand =

- **Impacts of competition on populations:**

- **Why are there still less competitive species?**
    - Less competitive species may still thrive as they may establish in **unoccupied areas**, or have **alternative life strategies** (Ex: some species may be an inferior competitor but a much better disperser)

## Competition Summary
- Competition occurs when a resource (Ex: light, water, etc.) is in **limited supply**, possibly leading to a reduction in the survivorship, growth, and/or reproduction of plants who fail to compete against others for the limited resources
- Can be assessed at the scale of an **individual** or a **population**
- Competition increases more rapidly over time under **favorable conditions**; good growing conditions allow competition to run its course more swiftly
- Competition is a key factor determining the **size distribution** of a population (better competitors outgrowing weaker ones) and in the **species composition** in a community (entire species out-competing other species)
