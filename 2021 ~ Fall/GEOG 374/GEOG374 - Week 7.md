# GEOG374 - Week 7: Plant Interactions & Plant Population/Communities
- Plant interactions:
    - Competition
    - **Allelopathy**
    - **Facilitation** (commensalism)

# Allelopathy
- **Allelopathy** = biological phenomenon by which an organism produces one or more biochemicals that influence the germination, growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms

- **Sources of allelopathic compounds:**
    - Volatilization from leaves
    - Leaching from leaves by rain, fog, or dew
    - Leaching from plant litter
    - Exudation from roots
    - Decay of sloughed tissue from roots

- **Impacts of allelopathy:**
    - Toxic effects
    - Hinder the development of other species
    - Auto-toxicity (soil sickness)

## Examples of Allelopathy
- Isolated compounds
- Toxic effects on native North American range plants
- Weak effects on native Eurasian plants
- Promote nutrient uptake
- **Effects are not constant:**
    - Knapweed slightly better competitor
    - Better connection with mycorrhizae to capture P

- **Positive and negative allelopathy**
    - When term was coined it only referred to negative impacts
    - Definition evolved over time to include positive effects

- **Example of allelopathy in California chaparral:**
    - Absence of herbs at the base of the shrubs
        - Allelopathy due to volatile compounds?
        - Use of fences > presence of herbs
            - Rodents searching protection from birds and feeding on herbs
    - Controlled experiment over 22 native species showed
        - 2 inhibited
        - 11 unaffected
        - 9 benefited

## Allelopathy Summary
- Allelopathy is a “chemical warfare” between plants
- Hinders the establishment and the growth of other plants species and can even lead to their death
- Does exist but is hard to prove in natural settings
- Has a variable impact on other plants

# Facilitation
- **Facilitation** = species interaction that benefit at least one of the participants and cause harm to neither

- Facilitation and **stress level**
    - Stress gradient hypothesis = facilitation becomes exponentially more important as abiotic and biotic stress increases

- **Evolution of the relationship over time:**
    - A relationship that is facilitative in the short term may grow to become a competitive relationship over time as the species being benefited starts to out-compete the other species

- Protection from physical stress in a salt marsh
    - Facilitation occurring:
        - Decrease in soil salinity and protection against waves favor the growth of plants
        - Faster growth even in presence of more competition!
    - Competition occurring:
        - Greater competition hinders the growth of plants
        - Salt concentration not limiting

## Facilitative Mechanisms
- Indirect biotic facilitation (pathogens)
- Abiotic facilitation - nutrient enrichment
- Abiotic facilitation – micro-climate amelioration

## Facilitation Summary
- Facilitation provides an advantage to one species in a relationship without hindering the second species
    - However over time this can turn into a competitive relationship as one species may out-compete the other
- Includes several mechanisms (biotic, nutrient, micro-climate, physical)
- Plays a greater role in harsher growing conditions
    
# Plant Population
- **Plant population** = "all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical are, and have the capability of interbreeding"

- The number of individuals is **not static**

- **Modelling population dynamic:**
    - - n (t+1) = n(t) + B(t) - D(t) + I(t) - E(t)
    - Where:
        - t = time (e.g., years)
        - n(t) = initial number of individuals
        - B(t) = number of birth
        - D(t) = number of death
            - **Number of deaths varies with life stages** (higher mortality as seed than mature plant)
        - I(t) = number of individual immigrating
        - E(t) = number of individual emigrating
        - Modelling can be straightforward for animals but for plants

## Specificities of Plant Population
- **Plant age/size can be unreliable**
    - Some plants can sit and wait or grow rapidly in the same time
    - Events can revert plants to a "younger" age

- Because of unreliability of plant age, **life stage** can be used in population models

- **Identification of individuals:**
    - An individual can have several stems (Ex: trembling aspen, fern)
- **Reproduction method:** 
    - Variable origin of seeds (annual seed production, seedbank)
    - Vegetative reproduction (higher establishment success rate and lower mortality rate)
- **Immigration and emigration:**
    - Distance varies with reproduction method
        - Vegetative
        - Seeds (wind, animal, water, etc.)

## Other Relavent Factors that Impact Plant Population
- Carrying capacity of the ecosystem
- Random events:
    - Population stochasticity
    - Environmental stochasticity

## Terraforming of Mars: Predicting future plant population
- **Your objective:**
    - Identify the elements of a model to predict the number of individuals; Assume the growing conditions are similar in the studied area (Ex: soil, temperature, water availability)

-**Model to predict future population should include:**
    - Initial number of individuals
    - Birth rate
    - Death rate
    - Immigration & emigrations

## Plant Population Summary
- Populations are composed of individuals of the same group or species (local)
- Plant population dynamics have several similarities and dissimilarities with animal populations
    - Similarities:
        - Carrying capacity (amount of resources available)
        - Impacted by random events
    - Dissimilarities:
        - Age > plants can have different life stages at same age
        - Different establishment methods > different birth, mortality, emigration and immigration rates

# Plant Communities
- **Plant community** = A plant community is a collection or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types

## Identification of Communities
- Opposing views: **Clements vs. Gleason**
    - **Clements = structured community unit**
        - Community as organized entities (super-organism evolving over time)
        - Very tight linkages among species (cooperation)
        - Only species interactions determine community structure
        - Communities are spatially distinct
    - **Gleason = random individualistic**
        - Communities result from interactions between species, environment, chance, and historical events
        - Limits of communities are gradual (less distinct)
        - Communities are an arbitrary construct, and their composition varies from place to place

- **Who is right?**
    - According to Clements: Abrupt changes between communities
    - According to Gleason: **Gradual changes between communities**
        - There is support towards this view; more realistic as the boundaries between communities are not abrupt, some species bleed into other communities

- **Today's view:**
    - Middle position between Clements’s and Gleason’s view
        - Species are distributed individualistically
        - Gradual changes in composition along environmental gradients (usually)
        - Species interactions may influence community structure
