# GEOG374 - Week 8: Disturbances (Fire, Herbivores, Wind)
- **Case study:** Close to nature forest management
    - Your objective: find **characteristics of disturbances** that can be used in the management of Quebec forests

# Disturbances
- **Disturbance** = partial or total destruction of the plant biomass and arises from the activities of herbivores, pathogens, man (trampling, mowing, and plowing), and from phenomena such as wind damage, frosts, desiccation, soil erosion, and fire
    - Any relatively discrete event in time that **disrupts ecosystems, their composition, structure, and function**

- **Characteristics of disturbances:**
    - Ubiquitous
    - Frequency (return interval)
    - Severity (mortality)
    - Size
    - Ecosystem dependent
    - Specific

## Understanding Responses to Disturbances
- Key factors:
    - Understanding **damages to plants**
    - Understand the **legacy of disturbances**

# Fire
- There are three basic types of forest fires:
    - **Crown fires** burn trees up their entire length to the top. These are the most intense and dangerous forest fires
    - **Surface fires** burn only surface litter and duff. These are the easiest fires to put out and cause the least damage to the forest
    - **Ground fires** (also called smouldering fires) occur in deep accumulations of humus, peat and similar dead vegetation that become dry enough to burn. These fires move very slowly, but can become difficult to fully put out, or suppress (can even burn through the winter)

- **Cause of fires:**
    - Lighting strikes
        - Account for less than half of fires but cause more damage because fires caused by lightning often occur in remote places and can do more damage
    - Humans
        - Account for more than half of fires but cause less overall damage because they occur in populated areas with fast response times 

## Fire Ignition
- Three elements are required for fire to thrive:
    - **Oxygen** to start and maintain combustion (wind)
    - **Heat** to reach ignition point and ignite fire (wind)
        - Ex: Lighting, human activities
    - Adequate **fuel** to sustain/carry fire (fuel continuity)
        - Quasi-random distribution of fire

- Once a fire starts, it will continue burning only if **heat, oxygen and more fuel are present**
    - To put out a fire requires eliminating one or more of the fire triangleâ€™s elements:
        - Cooling fuels below the combustion temperature through the use of water, foam, retardant or dirt
        - Cutting off the oxygen supply through the use of water, retardant, or dirt
        - Removing fuel by clearing a swath of trees and bushes ahead of the advancing fire

## Fire Behavior
- Factors affecting fire behavior:
    - **Weather**
        - Wind
        - Humidity
        - Drought
    - **Landform/terrain**
        - Slope
        - Aspect, elevation
        - Hill (slope, drainage)
    - **Vegetation**
        - Canopy
        - Surface
        - Ground

## Mortality Patterns
- **Fire behavior** determines the **fire affects**
    - Crown fire > snags (completely burnt trees are left behind)
        - High mortality
    - Active surface fire > scorched lower needles (but tops of forest cover left intact)
        - Low mortality
    - Creeping ground fire > some snags (but most trees survive)
        - Low mortality
