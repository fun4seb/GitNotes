# GEOG374 - Week 8: Disturbances (Fire, Herbivores, Wind)
- **Case study:** Close to nature forest management
    - Your objective: find **characteristics of disturbances** that can be used in the management of Quebec forests

# Disturbances
- **Disturbance** = partial or total destruction of the plant biomass and arises from the activities of herbivores, pathogens, man (trampling, mowing, and plowing), and from phenomena such as wind damage, frosts, desiccation, soil erosion, and fire
    - Any relatively discrete event in time that **disrupts ecosystems, their composition, structure, and function**

- **Characteristics of disturbances:**
    - Ubiquitous
    - Frequency (return interval)
    - Severity (mortality)
    - Size
    - Ecosystem dependent
    - Specific

## Understanding Responses to Disturbances
- Key factors:
    - Understanding **damages to plants**
    - Understand the **legacy of disturbances**

# Fire
- There are three basic types of forest fires:
    - **Crown fires** burn trees up their entire length to the top. These are the most intense and dangerous forest fires
    - **Surface fires** burn only surface litter and duff. These are the easiest fires to put out and cause the least damage to the forest
    - **Ground fires** (also called smouldering fires) occur in deep accumulations of humus, peat and similar dead vegetation that become dry enough to burn. These fires move very slowly, but can become difficult to fully put out, or suppress (can even burn through the winter)

- **Cause of fires:**
    - Lighting strikes
        - Account for less than half of fires but cause more damage because fires caused by lightning often occur in remote places and can do more damage
    - Humans
        - Account for more than half of fires but cause less overall damage because they occur in populated areas with fast response times 

## Fire Ignition
- Three elements are required for fire to thrive:
    - **Oxygen** to start and maintain combustion (wind)
    - **Heat** to reach ignition point and ignite fire (wind)
        - Ex: Lighting, human activities
    - Adequate **fuel** to sustain/carry fire (fuel continuity)
        - Quasi-random distribution of fire

- Once a fire starts, it will continue burning only if **heat, oxygen and more fuel are present**
    - To put out a fire requires eliminating one or more of the fire triangleâ€™s elements:
        - Cooling fuels below the combustion temperature through the use of water, foam, retardant or dirt
        - Cutting off the oxygen supply through the use of water, retardant, or dirt
        - Removing fuel by clearing a swath of trees and bushes ahead of the advancing fire

## Fire Behavior
- Factors affecting fire behavior:
    - **Weather**
        - Wind
        - Humidity
        - Drought
    - **Landform/terrain**
        - Slope
        - Aspect, elevation
        - Hill (slope, drainage)
    - **Vegetation**
        - Canopy
        - Surface
        - Ground

## Mortality Patterns
- **Fire behavior** determines the **fire affects**
    - Crown fire > snags (completely burnt trees are left behind)
        - High mortality
    - Active surface fire > scorched lower needles (but tops of forest cover left intact)
        - Low mortality
    - Creeping ground fire > some snags (but most trees survive)
        - Low mortality

## Return Interval
- **Return interval** = The time between fires in a defined area
    - Average frequency of fires for a given area; different depending on local conditions and biome

- The return interval of a fire impacts the average **age distribution** of plants in an area:
    - Shorter return intervals mean fires are more frequent and result in the average age of plants in an area being younger (older plants are wiped out by frequent fires)
    - Ex: an area with a return interval of 10 years will have many younger plants vs. an area with a return interval of 100 years will have more mature plants as there is more time to grow between disturbances

- Examples of fire return interval:
    - Prairies: 2-3 years
    - Chaparral: 25-100 years
    - Boreal forest: 25-1000 years
    - Pacific Northwest coastal forest: rare or absent

## Vegetation Response to Fire
- Species attributes relative to early post fire rejuvenation:
    - First vital process: mode of regeneration and reproduction
        - **Vegetative based:**
            - V species: able to resprout if burned in the juvenile stage
            - W species: able to resist fire in the adult stage and to continue extension growth after it (although fire kills juveniles)
        - **Disseminule based:**
            - D species: with highly disperse propagules
            - S species: storing long-lived propagules in the soil
            - C species: storing propagules in the canopy
    - Second vital process: communal relationships
        - T species: tolerants that can establish immediately after a fire and can persist indefinitely thereafter without further perturbations
        - R species: tolerants that cannot establish immediately after fire but must wait until some requirement has been met (Ex: shade)
        - I species: intolerants that can only establish immediately after a fire; Rapid growth pioneers, they tend to die out without recurrent disturbances

## Fire Summary
- Weather, fuel quantity, fuel continuity, and landforms determine fire behavior
- Plant mortality and legacy observed at several scales (individual/local to landscape)
- Fire return interval influences the age distribution of communities
- Fire types and return interval vary among ecosystems
- Different strategies used by plants allow them to survive or establish after a fire event
