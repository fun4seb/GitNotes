# GEOG374 - Week 9: Exam 2 Review
- **Question:** What does "fertilization" mean?
    - The application of any organic or inorganic material of natural or synthetic origins to a soil to supply one or more elements essential to the growth of plants
    - **Examples of organic and inorganic material used to fertilize:**
        - Manure (animal waste)
        - Compost
        - Crop rotations
        - Synthetic compound
        - ≠ Liming (used to control pH)

# Life History Strategies
- Explains the success of organisms in their environment
- Involves **tradeoffs** between where and how to allocate resources (e.g., physiology, growth, architecture, reproduction)

- Classification:
    - r-species and K-species
    - CSR model (competition, stress and ruderal)

# Plant Competition
- Competition occurs when a resource is in limited supply. It may lead to a reduction in the survivorship, growth and/or reproduction of a plant
    - Can be assessed at the scale of an **individual** or a **community**

- Competition increases over time, but more rapidly under **favourable conditions**
- Competition can be a key factor in the size distribution of a population and in the species composition of a community

# Allelopathy
- **Allelopathy** = "chemical warfare" between plants
- Hinders the establishment and growth of other plants species (and can even cause death)
- Allelopathy does exist however it is hard to prove in natural settings, why?
- Has a variable impact on other plants

# Facilitation
- **Facilitation** = relationship between two species in which one species is benefited without hindering the second one
    - Can turn into a competitive relationship over time (as the advantaged species out-competes the other species eventually)

- Includes several mechanisms (biotic, nutrient, microclimate, physical)
- Facilitation plays a greater role in harsher conditions

# Plant Populations
- Plant populations are composed of individuals of the same group or species (local)

- Plant population dynamics have several similarities and dissimilarities with **animal populations**
    - **Similarities:**
        - Carrying capacity
        - Impacted by random events
        - Mortality patterns
    - **Dissimilarities:**
        - Age → life stages
        - Different establishment methods → different birth, emigration and immigration rates

# Plant Communities
- Plant communities are a collection/association of plant species within a designated geographical unit (local)
- Communities result from a structured and/or a random clustering of species
    - Environmental and/or species interactions

- The concept of plant communities is used as a tool for the management of natural resources or for the description of local vegetation
