# GEOG274 - Week 11: Ecosystems & Biomechanical Cycling

# Ecosystems and the Biosphere
- **Biosphere** = living organisms **AND** their environment
- **Ecosystem** = assemblage of all organisms that **live in a particular zone**, including their physical environment
    - Ecosystem > biome > biosphere
    - The main difference between biosphere and ecosystem is in their spatial extent

## Biosphere
- **Biosphere** = the sphere of life and organic activity, from ocean floor to ~8 km into the atmosphere
- **Biota** = living organisms

- It is an **open** system (has inputs of **energy** and **matter**)
    - **Materials:** 
        - Water (precipitation)
        - Rocks (weathering)
    - **Energy:**
        - Heat/light energy (solar radiation)
        - Chemical energy (chemical reactions within the crust and atmosphere)
        - Kinetic energy (water and air movement)

# Cycling of Elements
- **Essential elements** = H, O, C, N, P, S
    - Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen: essential components of organic molecules (99%)
    - Nitrogen: required for proteins (included in amino acid structure)
    - Phosphorus: part of the DNA molecules, in plants it is needed for cell reproduction and division, part of the cell membrane
    - Sulfur: is a component of amino acids

- **Flux** (flow) and **reservoir** (storage; time of elements in storage = **residence time**)
- **Biomechanical cycle**: a pathway by which a chemical element or molecule moves through both **biotic** (biosphere) and **abiotic** (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) reservoirs of the planet

## Hydrological Cycle
- **Major water reservoirs** = water vapor (in atmosphere), oceans, inland waters (rivers, lakes, etc.), and groundwater

- Moves water through all parts of the geosphere
- Mediates transfer of elements (in solution and directly)

## Carbon Cycle
- **Major carbon reservoirs** (from smallest to largest) = atmospheric carbon, living biomass, atmospheric CO2, oceanic dissolved CO2, oceanic carbonate ion, organic carbon in soils/sediments, marine carbonate sediments, fossil fuels, oceanic bicarbonate ion, organic carbon in sedimentary rocks, limestone in sedimentary rocks
    - In general oceans are the biggest reservoirs for carbon as they cover ~70% of the Earth's surface

- Deeply integrated in all geospheres; large network of flows and reservoirs
- There is a link between the largest reservoirs and the oldest reservoirs, as the oldest storage places have a longer time to accumulate surplus carbon

- The carbon has a **short-term** (fast) cycle, and a **long-term** (slow) cycle
    - Fast Cycle: atmosphere (CO2), surface ocean (dissolved CO2), surface land (organic carbon)

- **Deposition of carbon** = rock weathering on land + transport in rivers = deposition of carbon into the ocean
    - This process is due to hydrolysis and dissolution of minerals
