# GEOG274 - Week 4: Earth Materials, Rock Cycling, and Transformation

# Geologic Cycle
- **Internal** process build landforms, while **external** processes (mainly weathering and erosion) reshape those landforms

- **Rock cycle** = produces igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks
- **Tectonic cycle** = brings heat energy and new material to the surface and recycles old material (moves and reshapes crust)
- **Hydrologic cycle** = processes Earth materials with the chemical and physical action of water, ice, and wind (weathering & erosion)

## Tectonic Cycles
- Magma rises from the asthenosphere, solidifies, adds to the plates' edges, moves laterally, cools and thickens, becomes denser, collides and subducts under a less dense place
    1. Seafloor spreading
    2. Subduction
    3. Melting
