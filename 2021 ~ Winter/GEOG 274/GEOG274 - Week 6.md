# Geomorphic Cycle
- Geomorphic features on the planet are in a state of **dynamic equilibrium**

- **Geomorphic equilibrium** = the balancing act between tectonic uplift, and resistance of rocks vs. reduction by weathering and erosion
- **Geomorphic threshold** = the point at which there is enough energy to overcome resistance against movements
- **Geomorphic cycle**:
    1. Equilibrium stability
    2. A destabilizing event (Ex: geomorphic threshold exceeded)
    3. A period of adjustment
    4. Development of a new and different condition of equilibrium

# Mass Movement on a Slope
- **Forces on slopes are determined by:**
    - Type of material
    - Slope and angle of topography
    - Vegetation
    - Climate
    - Water
    - Time

- "When a boulder is poised and ready to move it has **potential energy**, when it is rolling that potential energy is realized as **kinetic energy**"

- Mass movement of an object on a slope = **gravity (driving) vs. friction (resisting)**
    - **Critical sheer stress** = point at which the displacement stress overcomes the resistance (and movement begins to occur)
 
## Slope (In)stability
- **Gravity vs. friction**; three criteria that will determine when motion will start (critical sheer stress) include the **angle of the slope**, **cohesion of material**, and the **type of material itself**

- **External** conditions impacting slope instability
    1. Adding mass at the top = higher stress (Ex: sediment disposition)
    2. Steepening slop (Ex: fault movements)
    3. Removing support from below (Ex: erosion) = lower cohesion
    4. Wetting of the material 

- **Internal** conditions impacting slope instability
    1. Inherently weak materials (Ex: clay)
    2. Water (Ex: accumulation, loosing, erosion)
    3. Adverse geological structures (Ex: ancient slips, orientation of rock layers, clay or soft rock layers)

- A landscape is **stable** if its resistance to motion (sheer strength) exceeds the weathering and erosion processes (sheer stress)
    - Ex: gentle slope, vegetated soil
- A landscape is **unstable** if the resistance to motion (sheer strength) of its materials is weaker than the weathering and erosion processes (sheer stress)
    - Ex: steep slope, sandy soil

## Processes on a Slope
- 3 distinct processes occurring on a slope in order
    1. **Weathering**; parts of exposed rock faces will be weathered and produce rock debris
    2. **Transportation**; weathered rock debris will be transported down the slope
    3. **Deposition**; rock debris settles at the bottom of the slope where it is deposited
        - Deposition occurs at the lowest point of the slope and therefor mechanical sorting of material takes place; **the lower down the slope, the more fine the material will be**

## Mass Movement Triggers
- Mass movement (landslide) is initiated by:
    - Tectonic forces (don't necessarily cause movement, only act as trigger)
    - Heavy rain, floods
    - Thawing of frozen ground, frost wedging
    - Human activities (Ex: construction, mining, water/oil/gas withdrawals)

## Mass Movement General Terms
- **Mass movement (mass wasting)** = spontaneous downward movement of soil, regolith, or bedrock due to gravity
- **Bedrock** = consolidated rock
- **Regolith** = layer of unconsolidated rock overlying bedrock; might be residual or transported
- **Soil** = unconsolidated naturally occurring material, <2 mm in diameter, at surface, variable depth
- **Talus** = Mass of rock fragments produced by physical weathering
- **Angle of repose** = the steepness of a slope where loose material comes to rest, depending on the size and texture of the grains 

## Elements of a Slope
- Bedrock is the **parent rock** from which weathered regolith and soils develop
- Regolith is broken-up rock (due to weathering, shattering, etc.)

- The parent rock material determines the slope:
    - **Harder** material will form steeper cliff faces (free face), and falling material will create a **talus** (rockfall deposit) below
    - **Softer** material will form smoother slopes with concave, convex, and straight points

- **Downward**:
    - **Falling (fast)**
        - Free fall of earth material
        - **Rockfall** = piece of bedrock separates and falls in nearly vertical path, shattering on impact and creating a talus layer below
    - **Subsiding (slower)**
        - Collapse of ground surface into a cavity below, usually produced by removal of underlying material
        - Ex: sinkhole; vertical downward movement, collapsing into the void

- **Downward-and-outward**:
    - **Sliding (slow)**
        - Movement of material as coherent rock
        - Top and bottom of material move at the same rate
        - **Slumping** = sliding along a curved surface
        - **Soil slip** = sliding along a tilted surface
        - **Rock slide/landslide** = sliding along a planar surface
    - **Flowing (fast)**
        - Movement of unconsolidated material (acting as a viscous liquid; Ex: mudflow)
        - Top and bottom of material move at different rate
        - **Soil creep** = very slow flowage
        - Earth flow, debris flow, and avalanche = rapid flowage

# Weathering and Erosion
- **Weathering processes** break down rock at Earth's surface and to some depth below the surface, either disintegrating rocks into particles or dissolving it in water
- **Erosion** includes the transport or weathered materials to different locations

- Two types of weathering processes:
    1. **Physical weathering (mechanical weathering)** = the process of rock breakage without any chemical alteration (rock fragmentation)
        - Dominates in drier and cooler climates
    2. **Chemical weathering** = process of actual decomposition and decay of the constituent minerals in rock due to chemical reaction (almost always in the presence of water)
        - Dominates in wetter and warming climates

- **Hydraulic action** = a type of erosive process performed by flowing water alone (squeeze-and-release action that loosens and lifts rocks); more powerful upstream due to more energy/turbulent flow

## Factors Influencing Weathering Processes
- Rock composition and structure, jointing(increases both physical and chemical weathering by surface exposition)

- **Vegetation**
    - Vegetative cover can protect rock by shielding it from raindrop impact
    - Roots can stabilize soil
    - Roots also produce organic acids and enhance chemical weathering
    - Plant roots can also break up rock
- **Water** (surface and subsurface)
- **Climatic conditions**
    - Precipitation, temperature, and freeze-thaw cycles

## Physical Weathering Processes
- **Freeze-thaw weathering cycles** (water that occupies openings in rocks that expands when frozen, stressing the rock and wedging it open with repeated cycles of freezing and thawing)
- **Salt formation** (growth of salt crystals from previously evaporated saltwater in cavities that stress the surrounding rock; similar to freeze-thaw but occurring much slower with growth of salt crystals rather than ice)
- **Thermal expansion** (expansion of all underlying elements in rock due to changes in temperature; common in deserts and fire areas)
- **Unloading (pressure-release jointing)**
    - **Joints** are fractures/separations in rock that occur without displacement of the sides
    - Joints **increase the surface area of rock** exposed to both physical and chemical weathering
- **Biological activity** (roots and wood species that exert expansive forces as they grow and enlarge, wedging open and rock crack they may be growing through)

## Chemical Weathering Processes
- May include **mineral alteration** (no change in chemical composition), or **mineral decomposition** (change in composition of rock minerals)
- Dominates in wet and/or warm regions and generally occurs in joints and fractures, or at rock corners; **meaning more joint/corners = more weathering**

- **Includes:**
    - Hydration
    - Hydrolysis
    - Dissolution
    - Carbonation
    - Oxidation

### Hydration, Hydrolysis, Oxidation, 
- **Hydration** = "combination with water"; little chemical change
    - Water becomes part of the chemical composition of the mineral
    - Hydrated materials expand, creating a strong mechanical effect (a wedging pressure that stresses the rock, forcing grains apart
- **Hydrolysis** = minerals (silicates) chemically combine with water and **acids**
    - A decomposition process that breaks down rock minerals
    - Ions released from mineral
    - For silicates: silicic acid formed by hydrogen and silica (Ex: clays in temperate areas)
    - Slow process
- **Oxidation** = "reaction with oxygen"; elements lose electrons
    - Silicate minerals become stable oxides
    - **Iron** is the element most frequently oxidized (the rusting of iron in rock/soils produces a reddish-brown stain of iron oxide)

### Dissolution and Carbonation
- Minerals may dissolve into solution (Ex: chemical reaction with acid; fast process)
- Carbonate minerals prone to carbonation (Ex: calcite)
- Carbonation of **surface** outcrops of limestone = **limestone pavement**
- **Underground** in limestone bedrock = **caverns** and diverse deposits (Ex: stalagmites)

### Karst Landscapes
- **Karst topography/landscapes** = topographies created due to extensive **carbonation/dissolution** of underlying material (usually limestone)
- Karst landscapes may occur in the form of **caves, sinkholes, cockpits, and towers**
- Karst landscapes may evolve over time (Ex: cavern collapsing producing a valley)
- ~15% of Earths land is comprised of karst regions
