# GEOG274 - Week 8: Glacial and Periglacial Landscapes & Landforms, Permafrost

# Glacial Landscapes
- (Permanent) ice covers ~11% of the Earth's surface
- 77% of Earth's freshwater is frozen permanently
- Continental glaciers and sea ice: found at high altitudes
- Mountain glaciers: found at > 5 km elevation in tropics, at sea level at the poles

- **Glacier** = large mass of ice resting on land or floating as ice shelf in the sea adjacent to land
    - Two major types: **alpine** and **continental**
    - Glaciers move slowly in stream like patterns

- **Glacial ice formation (low to high density):**
    - Ice crystals form in atmosphere and fall to the surface (clouds, snow)
    - Accumulation (snow will remain for some time, such as years, depending on temperature; multi-year snowpack)
    - Compaction (crystals rounding)
    - Sintering (higher pressure + higher temperature = fusion of crystals through melting)
    - Ice (further compaction, glacial ice forms)

- **Structure of glacial vs. sea ice formation:**
    - New glacial ice forms **on top** of older ice
    - New sea ice forms **on the bottom** of older ice

## Ice Mass Balance and Motion
- Ice accumulates much faster in the **north**
- **Ice ablation (ice loss)** occurs by melting (Ex: Greenland) and calving (breakup of icebergs; Ex: Antarctica)

- Ice moves under the **pressure** of its own weight, driven by the pull of **gravity**
    - Top layers are **brittle**, bottom layers are **dense**
    - Upper layers move faster

- Average ice extent and residence times =

### Glacial Motion along a Slope
- Glacial/ice behavior on a slope is very similar to that of rock and water

- **Glacial erosion and deposition** = processes in which ice dislodges, dissolves, or removes weathered surface material and transports it to new locations
# Glaciers

- **Net accumulation of snow is highest at the top of a slope** and is lowest at the bottom of a slope (where melting and calving occurs; net negative accumulation)

## Continental & Alpine Glaciers
- **Continental glacier** = a continuous mass of ice much larger than an individual alpine glacier; < 50,000 km^2 (ice caps, ice fields)
- **Ice sheet** = a continental glacier > 50,000 km^2 (Antarctica and Greenland)

## Glaciers Erode and Transport Sediment
- **Glacial plucking** = a passing glacier mechanically picks up rock material and carries it away either on its surface or internally (englacially) 
    - The rock pieces frozen to the basal layers of the glacier enable the ice mass to scour the landscape as it moves, producing a smooth surface on exposed rock (glacial polish) when the glacier retreats; process of **abrasion**

### Landforms of Glacial Erosion
- **Small scale features:** glacial grooves, chatter marks, crescentic gouges, striation marks

- **Roche moutonnee/glacial erratics** = large rocks picked up and moved by glaciers; result from both plucking and abrasion
- **Whaleback** = smooth, rounded bedrock range; resulting mainly from abrasion

### Landforms of Alpine Glacial Erosion
- **Moraines** = ridges of accumulated rock debris that has been transported and deposited by glacial ice
