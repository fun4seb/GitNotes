# GEOG274 - Week 9: The Geography of Soils

# Soil Origins
- Soil originates from rock fragments created through the weathering and erosion of initial landforms in the **lithosphere**

- The most significant physical providers of **parent soil material** are the processes of water, ice, and wind erosion that supply fine particles to be transported and deposited into soil

- The presence of water impacts the deposition of soil
    - **Stratified dirt** = soil with particles that are **layered** (stratified) by size due to being deposited in **meltwater**; soil particles deposited due to movement of water are layered homogeneously according to grain size
    - **Till** = soil that is comprised of a heterogeneous mix of particle sizes (unstratified) due to being deposited **without water**; results in a pebbly mix of large and small rocks and soil particles
    - **Outwash plane** = stratified deposits of silt and clay that are deposited by meltwater from retreating glaciers
    - **Till plane** = unstratified heterogeneous mix of particles that are deposited without water due to large ice sheet retreats 

- Wind as a mechanism of geomorphic change
    - Fine particles from glaciers (and others) are sometimes blown large distances around the world and re-deposited in unstratified homogeneous deposits to form sandy/silty deposit of fine material known as **loess**

## Loess Deposits
- From 6000+ years ago, pleistocene glaciers retreated and left behind large amounts of **till** and **meltwater** deposits of fine-grained **clays and silts**
    - These materials that were left behind were then blown large distances and re-deposited in unstratified and homogeneous deposits called **loess deposits**
    - **Silt (0.02-0.2 mm)** dominates these deposits

- Loess deposits make fertile soil because:
    - The deposits are deep (can be over 300 m in lowland areas)
    - They are naturally well drained and filtrated (mixed size particles and silt create natural filter)
    - Excellent structural strength of deposits due to water retention and clays
    - **All of these of characteristics of Earth's fertile "breadbasket" farming regions**

- Major global loess deposit locations = **"breadbasket" farming regions**
    - The largest glacial deposits of soil particles are associated with retreating ice sheets; where there is retreating ice sheets there are loess deposits (aeolian distribution)

# Natural Soil Formation Factors
- **Process of natural soil formation:**
    - The **parent material** (rock type from which the soil was weathered from) determines the basic mineral structure of the developing soil type
        - Weathering of rocks provides the raw mineral material component of soil **(addition)** 
        - The elemental makeup of the soil is determined by the type of weathering process enacted on the parent material, whether physical or chemical, that is due to climate **(translocation)**
    - **Topography and slope** also control erosion and the manner in which it is formed and deposited
    - Biological activity determines the **organic matter** that is present in the soil **(organics)**
    - **Time** is an important factor as these process require adequate time to transform parent material (rock) into soil; more time leads to better, more fertile soils **(transformation)**

# Human Impacts on Soil
- Soil is created at a rate of ~1 cm per 100 years; it is a long process related to the much faster process of the degradation of soils
    - ~35% of farmlands are losing soil much faster that it can form

- Poor farming practices = **losing soil faster than it can generate**
    - Farming regions are perpetually getting dryer and undergoing **desertification**, contributing to loss of fertile soil; global threat to future food security
    - Overgrazing, deforestation, and salinization (rising concentrations of salt in soils)

- **Sustainable farming practices include:**
    - Ploughing on the contour/reduced ploughing
    - No-till agriculture (reduces moisture loss, soil erosion, and encourages root growth)

# Soil Development
- Soil is an **open system**, whose development is affected by natural processes and human activities

- Soil = mixture of **~50% weathered rock and organic material** + **~50% water and air**

- The organic matter within soil (~5%) includes:
    - Living organisms and plant roots
    - Dead and partially decomposed plant and animal matter
    - **Humus** (Fully decomposed plant matter)

- **The soil profile is determined by:**
    - The parent materials
    - Specific variety of decomposing organic matter in a region
    - Bacterial processes (nutrient cycling)
    - **Bioturbation** = displacement of soil by living organisms (roots, worms, mammals); leads to more porous structure, deposits of organic matter within the soil, and percolation of water and air

## Edaphology & Pedology
- **Edaphology** = study of soil as a medium for **sustaining the plant growth**
- **Pedology** = study of soil origin, development, and distribution
    - **Ped** = a unit of soil
    - **Pedon** = smallest unit of soil showing all characteristics

- Soil profiles are analyzed in cross-sections of roughly stratified layers (horizons)

- **Soil horizons** = stratigraphically separate horizontal layers of soil
    - **O horizon (organic layer)** = top of soil profile, comprised of all organic matter and debris on the ground created by plants and mammals, from undecomposed to fully decomposed (humus) organic material
    - **A horizon (topsoil)** = rich in organic matter and is subject to land preparation such as ploughing, **humus and clay** particles are prominent as they provide essential chemical links between soil nutrients and plants; dark due to abundance of organic matter
    - **Ae horizon (eluviation layer)** = comprised of sand, silt, and leaching-resistant materials; water carries clay, aluminum oxide, and iron oxide to lower horizons while leaving behind sand and silt in a process known as **eluviation** that increases with precipitation
    - **B horizon (illuviation layer)** = clays, aluminum, and iron accumulate in this layer in a process known as **illuviation** (accumulation of leached materials from upper layers); due to the presence of leached metals this layer is a lighter yellowish/reddish hue
    - **C horizon (regolith layer)** = consists of weathered bedrock and parent material (regolith)
    - **R horizon (bedrock layer)** = comprised of consolidated bedrock

# Soil Characteristics
- **Soil fertility** = the ability of soil to grow plants

- **Physical properties of soil:**
    - Texture (amounts of different sized particles; sand-silt-clay ratio)
        - **Loam** = balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay that is good for plant growth
        - Course sand to sand = 2 mm - 0.2 mm
        - Fine sand to coarse silt = <0.2 mm
        - Silt = <0.02 mm
        - Clay = <0.002 mm
        - Colloid = <0.001 mm
    - Structure (arrangement of particles; size and shape of lumps)
    - Consistency (cohesion of the soil)
    - Porosity (spaces between soil particles; how porous the soil is)
    - Moisture (water content)
    - Color (hue; can change due to mineral content)

- **Chemical properties of soil:**
    - Colloids (particles less than ~0.001 mm dispersed in the soil solution)
    - Acidity/alkalinity of the soil (pH)
