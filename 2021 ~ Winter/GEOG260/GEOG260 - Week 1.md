# Reading Notes: Making Maps Chapter 2 (What's Your Map For?)
- **Do you really need a map?**
	- Sometimes maps are inappropriate; sometimes information does not want to be mapped by certain parties (Ex: Indigenous groups) and there might be more effective ways of making your point such as with a graph, drawing, photo, etc.

- **Who's your map for?**
	- Know your intended audience as this aids design decisions; knowing the familiarity of your audience changes the specificity of information being present and how detailed it must be to deliver the most effective map possible for the intended audience
		- Novices on a subject may need a more explanatory map however experts may expect a complex map that delivers more data that is of use to them practically; **knowing the audience is everything as it determines the exact quality and type of map that needs to be made**

- **How are you going to show it?**
	- Maps are made for viewing on many different mediums with many different sizes, while most maps may be made on the computer they aren't always the final medium (phone, paper, screen, sign, poster, etc.); what might look good on a computer wont necessarily look good on a phone screen so **tailor the design of your map to the medium**
		- Tailoring the map to the viewing medium and not the monitor entails designing with size in mind, average viewing distance (phone screen vs. billboard) as well as colored to accommodate the limitations of the medium (Ex: not all print will be in color so don't design a colored map for black and white print)

- **Document, Evaluate, Review**
	- Be constantly critical of your map during its creations, continually evaluate if it is servings its desired purpose
