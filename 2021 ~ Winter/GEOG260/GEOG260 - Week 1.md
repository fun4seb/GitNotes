# GEOG260 - Week 1: Mapping Transformations - Cognitive & Mathematical
> Module 1: Weeks 1 to 4; Mapping Transformations - Cognitive & Mathematical

- Info from **ANY READING** is fair game for exams; read **EVERYTHING**

# Lecture Notes
- Maps are about **POWER**

## Lab Materials
- Math drawing kit
- 30 cm ruler
- Pigment liner pens (1 fine, medium, and wide)
- Colored pencils

## History of Cartography
> Mapping is making things visible and making things visible is making them available to use (Pickles, 2004)

- **Notable timeline:**
    - 30,000 BC is when first maps start to be drawn on cave walls
    - 200 AD is when astrological maps start to be created
    - 19th century maps make a big split and become **thematic** and **statistical** maps

- **The world by Ptolemy (120 AD)**
    - First use of **grid system (lat & longs)**
    - Featured Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa) surrounded by on ocean to the West; also detailed the Roman Empire Eastern expansion
- **"O-T" Map of the Middle/Dark Ages (800 AD)**
    - AKA Isodoran map
    - Significant water features: Oceans, Mediterranean, the Nile, and the Don (Tanais)
    - Very few cities noted
    - Mapping knowledge was lost after the fall of the Greeks and Romans; the use of the "T-O" map by the church gave them a lot of power to control the way people viewed the world geographically during the Middle Ages
    - Mappa (cloth or chart) Mundi (of the world); Mappamundi (meaning map of the world), just another type of "T-O" map
- **Map of the Tracks of Yu the Great (before 1100 AD)**
    - Chinese map
    - Details such as coastlines and rivers
    - Contemporary to "T-O" maps
    - Engraved stone and could be reproduced by rubbings; first printable map
- **Al-Sharif al-Idrisi World (1154 AD)**
    - Map of Mediterranean created by Arabic scholar, commissioned by Roger II
    - Re-introduced grid system (Ptolemy)
    - Arabian Peninsula at the center (oriented with South facing up because that is the direction to **Mecca**)
- **Outside Europe, Asia, Africa**
    - Maps may take alternative formats (Ex: coastline mapped to wood)
    - Different spatial understandings
    - Process vs. product
- **Portolan chart (1541 AD)**
    - First use of **rhumb lines**
    - Navigational chart (compass based
- **World map from Battista (1543 AD)**
    - Italian map considered a work of art
    - Featured 12 "wind points" which evolved into the modern compass directions
    - Evolved grid (lat & long)
- **Enlightenment (1675 AD)**
    - More scientific; power base shifts from the church to academia as science begins to drive maps and their use
    - State sponsored
    - Mechanically reproduced
    - Celestial and solar navigation
- **Thematic (Choropleth) maps (Dupin 1826 AD)**
    - Spatial data (Ex: literacy rates of provinces coded by color)
    - Place & information relationships
    - Thematic information
- **Map & political satires (Tisdale 1812 AD)**
    - Maps as commentary
    - Convergence of politics, economy, humor, and art in maps
- **Aerial photography (1914 AD)**
     - Important to note that not all cultures understand the world spatially from a birds eye view like we do
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** & **Virtual globes**

# Reading Notes: Making Maps Chapter 2 (What's Your Map For?)
- **Do you really need a map?**
	- Sometimes maps are inappropriate; sometimes information does not want to be mapped by certain parties (Ex: Indigenous groups) and there might be more effective ways of making your point such as with a graph, drawing, photo, etc.

- **Who's your map for?**
	- Know your intended audience as this aids design decisions; knowing the familiarity of your audience changes the specificity of information being present and how detailed it must be to deliver the most effective map possible for the intended audience
		- Novices on a subject may need a more explanatory map however experts may expect a complex map that delivers more data that is of use to them practically; **knowing the audience is everything as it determines the exact quality and type of map that needs to be made**

- **How are you going to show it?**
	- Maps are made for viewing on many different mediums with many different sizes, while most maps may be made on the computer they aren't always the final medium (phone, paper, screen, sign, poster, etc.); what might look good on a computer wont necessarily look good on a phone screen so **tailor the design of your map to the medium**
		- Tailoring the map to the viewing medium and not the monitor entails designing with size in mind, average viewing distance (phone screen vs. billboard) as well as colored to accommodate the limitations of the medium (Ex: not all print will be in color so don't design a colored map for black and white print)

- **Document, Evaluate, Review**
	- Be constantly critical of your map during its creations, continually evaluate if it is servings its desired purpose
