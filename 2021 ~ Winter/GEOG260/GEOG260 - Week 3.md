# GEOG260 - Week 3: Design & Intro to Generalization

# Lecture Notes

## Essential Design Elements
- **Title**
    - Most important information is what, where, and when (Ex: "Median income in PSC 2010 2019 by postal code")
    - Title text should be 2-3 times larger than body text
 - **Scale**
    - Fractional scale vs. visual scale vs. verbal scale
    - Tobler's 1st law = "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"
  - **Direction indicator**
    - Clean and simple
    - Define North (Note: North may or may not be top edge of the map if it is not indicated)
 - **Legend**
    - Key to map interpretation
    - Must include a balance between the obvious and the necessary
    - DONT name it "legend"; does not require a header
- **Sources**
     - Info that must be include for maps made in this course:
        - Date sources & citations
        - Author/cartographer
        - Date of issue
      - Info found of educational and commercial maps:
        - Date of last update
        - Series (Ex: 1 of 1, or 1 of 5)
        - Projections & coordinates
- **Author & date**
    - Important to date and take responsibility for the maps you make; they are a reflection of the creator/time

## The Cartographic Process & Models
- **Process of map creation:**
    - **Environment** (real or imagined) > **map-maker** (who detects patterns in the environment and encodes them into visual information) > **map** (tangible/virtual, static/dynamic) > **map user** (who recognizes patterns and decodes the map) > **environment** (map users now spatially understand the environment and recognize new patterns, encouraging the creation of new maps; cyclical process)

- Influences on map design; a "double logic"
    - **Logic of map making**
        - Self-awareness of the designer (principles of the designer)
        - Rules, guidelines, and conventions (design principles)
            - These are linked to...
    - **Logic of design**
        - Experience
        - Sense of aesthetic, intuition, creativity
            - Both are interrelated, complimentary, and learnable

## Intellectual & Visual Hierarchies

### Layers
- Think of maps as **layers of information** (Ex: title + basemap + legend + water features + etc.)

## Intro to Visual Principles
- **Gestalt principles** = the psychological ways in which we take in visual information and create meaning
    - **Figure-ground relationships**
        - Relationship between objects in the foreground and background and why one might stand out over the other
        - Related to layering and making the right information take the dominant position in front to be seen as intended by the map-maker
    - **Proximity**
        - Shifts visual weight; impacts symmetry ("whats different and whats the same?")
        - The way we move things closer together impacts how we see and understand the map
    - **Similarity**
        - Implies "like" things are related; similarity = grouping
    - **Symmetry**
        - Symmetrical things are perceived as a unified group; objected that are symmetrical are grouped/related
        - Causes the eye to seek patterns and arrangements
    - **Closure**
        - Enhances the figure-ground relationship
        - Fills in the blanks; denotes layering
        - Shows interruption
    - **Continuity/continuation**
        - Overlapping implies single object
        - Organize curves, lines, and forms when grouped together
        - Common fate (things moving in a predictable/constant direction are continuous)
    - **Past experience**
        - Cultural association to symbols with common ideas due to past experiences (Ex: cross = religion, green = go)

### Creating Good Figure-Ground Relationships
- Use of **contrast** can distinguish between figure and ground
- Size of objects also play a role; bigger objects are perceived as the figure
    - Things on the bottom half of the page are also perceived as closer and draw the eye
- Objects in **focus** are perceived as the figure while other less in focus objects are less important

### Creating Effective Closure
- Effective closure is achieved through reducing the complexity of a design while still suggesting shapes
    - This can be done through the effective use of both positive and negative space to suggest shapes that are not visible
    - Contrast and color

### Tips for Proximity
- Make groups of like objects obvious through consistent use of shape & space
- Use with figure-ground (et al) to further increase the readability of the objects
- Exploit white blocks of color
- Placing text near a group of objects automatically links them together

## Generalization - Theoretical Frameworks
- **Generalization** = removing un-relavent information and simplifying where needed

- Generalization is a process of **selection** and **symbolization**; selection of relavent information to include and symbolization to reduce that information into efficiently readable symbols
    - Map makers **always subtract** and **NEVER add**; maps should always be a simplification and representation of reality, adding things that do not exist in the real world is bad

- **Operators** = the things you can alter
    - Content/feature
    - Geometry
    - Symbol
    - Label
- **Algorithms** = how we alter those operators; what decisions the map-maker is making
    - Ex: Remove roads with speed limits <20 km/h, simplify coastlines, replace text with symbols, etc.

- **Generalization is related to SCALE**; all decisions made while generalizing features on a map are to achieve usefulness and aesthetic readability at any specific scale

### Content/Feature Typologies
- All about **SELECTION**
    - Add/include
    - Remove or eliminate
    - Reclassify
        - **Reclassifying down to a smaller size is what will be done in assignment 1**
    - Reorder
        - Merging multiple categories into one (Ex: reducing five different thicknesses of river down to two)

### Geometry Typologies
- All about **ALTERATION**
    - Aggregate
        - Combine possibly cluttered data-points together to improve readability
    - Collapse
    - Merge
    - Displace
    - Exaggerate
    - Simplify
        - Commonly used on coastlines
    - Smooth

### Symbol Typologies
- All about the **MODIFICATION OF THE EXISTING**
    - Adjust color/icon/pattern/shape/size/opacity
    - Enhance
    - Rotate
    - Typify

### Label Typologies
- All about **IDENTIFICATION**
    - Add/remove label
    - Adjust label appearance/location

## Visual Variables
- A **mark** is "something that is visible and can be used to show relationships within sets of data"
- **Visual variables** are "the different ways that mark can be varied"

- Every **symbol** has two parts:
    1. Conceptual (what we think it is)
    2. Physical (what it actually is)

- a **graphic mark** is made up of code & convention
    - Denotation = most common **objective** meaning of a word/sign; what you see
    - Connotation = most common **subjective** meaning of a word/sign; what you think when you see it

### Semiology of Graphics
- **Semiology:**
    - Study of particular languages
    - Ferdinand de Saussure (1875-1973)
    - Dyadic (two) relation: sign, signifier, signified = meaning
- **Semiotic:**
    - Canonic approach of the philosophy of languages
    - Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914)
    - Triadic (three) relation: sign, signifier, signified, interpreter = meaning
