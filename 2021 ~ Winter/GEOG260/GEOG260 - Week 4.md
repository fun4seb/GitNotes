# GEOG260 - Week 4: Principles of Map Making, Non-Essential Elements of Cartographic Design & Construction

# Lecture Notes

## The Concept of Map Abstraction
- You can express almost anything on a map through **points, lines, and polygons**; basic units of mapping
- Reduction of complexity to make it more readable 

## Map Symbolization & Visual Variables - Points, Lines, and Polygons
- Symbols are **graphic marks tied to concepts**, symbols are also **concepts tied to graphic marks**; both feed each other and are inseparable

- Each visual variable than can be changed (shape, texture, color, etc.) is either better suited to show **qualitative differences** or **quantitative differences** or **both** (Ex: like texture)

- **What can be changed:**
    - Shape
        - Could be used to indicate a **quality** that distinguishes data-points
    - Size
        - Could be used to indicate a **quantity** that stratifies a single type of data-point
        - Ex: using different sized circles for different categories could be confusing but different size circles for quantifying **one category** is clear
    - Texture
        - Could be used to indicate both **quality** AND **quantity**; can also enhance a figure-ground relationship and make certain elements stand out
    - Color
    - Orientation
    - Position
    - Value
- **What they express:**
    - Relationships
    - Differences
    - Resemblances
- **What they exploit:**
    - Patterns
    - Conventions
    - Standards

- **Grouping principles** (how do we show a relationship?)
    - Similar shape
    - Similar size
    - Proximity

## Using Hierarchy
- There is a **hierarchy** of the variables that should be presented in a way so that certain things always pop out before other things so that **everything is not competing for equal attention at one time**
    - i.e. "order of things to make 'pop'"

### Considering Eye Movement & Arrangement
- When arranging visual objects one must always consider the **path** the eye will take across the page to view the information, and make it so information is arranged in a way to compliment the natural path the eye will take

- The way people's eyes read maps is hard to determine because it it not so universal (compared to predicting the eye movement when looking at a book or poster)
    - Individualistic
    - Hard to predict
    - Experimentation
    - Trial and error
    - Influenced by cultural reading habits (Ex: Western left-right, top-bottom)

- Knowing this, creating effective arrangements is a matter of considering the eye movement of the reader, and arranging the information in a way to accommodate the path
    - Ex: The body of the map should be in the **visual center** of the page; visual center is located slightly above and left of page center

- **Balance:**
    - Relationships between map elements
    - Visual weight
    - Visual harmony

- **Symmetry:**
    - Related to balance
    - Arrangement on axis
    - Tone and feel
    - Modern edge or traditional style
    - **Asymmetry** can also be used in moderation to make elements pop or the overall arrangement more interesting

- **Alignment:**
    - Non-visible
    - Connecting elements
    - Stability and order
    - Aids focus
    - Achieving good alignment of elements is simply a matter of extrapolating edges to lie on the same line (Ex: Just like in Google slides where objects all align on the same blue line)

- **Grids:**
    - Related to symmetry
    - Axis of alignment
    - Horizontal and vertical
    - Margins

## Text Placement
- **Summary:**
    - Names should be associated with features
    - Letters spaced as little as possible (except for areas)
    - Letters spaced consistently in each name
    - Names should either be entirely on land or water
    - Names of points should be horizontal (or following the grid/readable left-right when reading from right side)
    - Names should be curved as little as possible
    - Lettering should never be upside down

### Labeling Points
- When labeling points there must be space between the labels of different points so the point a specific label belongs to is not arbitrary

> When labeling point symbols on a map, start at the center of the map and work outward. For each symbol, follow these priorities... (for label placement; 1-8)

- With a point in the center, the first place you should put a label if space allows is **upper-right (1)**, then **upper-left (2)**, then **lower-right (3)**, then **lower-left (4)**, then **middle-right (5)**, then **middle-left (6)**, then **upper-left-of-center (7)**, then **lower-right-of-center (8)**

- Labels should also lie **completely in one land-type**, rather than having a label extend off land into the water
- Finally labels should also rotate to be **parallel with the grid**

### Labeling Lines
> Type should be placed upright, and should read from left to right. Vertical type should be readable from the right side of the page

## Non-Essential Design Elements
- Non-essential design elements are things that **add value and understandability**
    - Insets & locators
        - Shifts between scales, providing detail by a large scale shift (insets), or providing context by a small scale shift
    - Boarders
        - Sometime a border is warranted to enhance figure-ground however is not always necessary and depends on the use of the map being created
    - Explanatory texts
        - Provides context, interprets the content, and clarifies the goals of the map
        - "Concise and informative material supporting the visual information on the map, where visual communication tools may need support or explanation"

- Such elements are **non-distracting, not essential, however very helpful to the reader**
