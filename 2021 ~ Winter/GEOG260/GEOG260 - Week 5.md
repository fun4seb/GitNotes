# GEOG260 - Week 5: Design Review, Thematic Maps, Data Types

# Visual Variables (Condensed)
- **Attributes**
    - Position = location changes (x,y,z)
    - Size = length or area changes
    - Shape = polygon changes
    - Value = shade/tint changes 
    - Orientation = alignment changes
    - Color = hue changes
    - Texture = pattern changes

- **Characteristics**
    - Selective = tell one things from another
    - Associative = tells what things are grouped
    - Quantitative = tells if it can be counted or measured
    - Order = tells how it can be ranked

- **Some attributes are better/more suited to conveying certain characteristics than others**

# Thematic Maps
- **Special purpose maps** (Ex: climate change)
    - Focus attention on the **structure** of the distribution
    - Capture the basic structure of geographical phenomena
    - Can be at any scale (structure more important than accuracy)

## Thematic Map Process
- Starts with defining the **data type**:
    - Nominal = resemblance
    - Ordinal = rank
    - Numerical = proportional

- The data will then be **expressed graphically**:
    - Points
    - Lines
    - Polygons

## How Do Thematic Maps Work?
- Communicative power of maps is how it can simultaneously explain relationships between 3 distinct variables
    1. X location
    2. Y location
    3. Mapped variable
    - **There are also 3 levels of relationship between location and the mapped variable**
        1. Nominal = resemblance/identity
        2. Ordinal = rank/order
        3. Numerical = proportion/count

## Types of Thematic Maps
- Choropleth map
    - Uses color to represent statistical information
    - Good for showing relationships and ratios
    - Usable mainly for numerical data, however could also be used for nominal data in some cases (Ex: red states vs. blue states)
- Dot density map
    - Uses dots to show quantity/numerical data and relates them based on the density/frequency of the data points in a given area
- Isarithmic & isopleth map
    - "Weather maps"
    - Connects areas within the map with line/color that have the same value of data
- Proportional symbol map
    - Similar to choropleth maps; uses symbols (size, shape, etc.) to differentiate data rather than color/value

# Spatial Analysis & Data Visualization
- **Spatial analysis**
    - Find and understand relationships
    - Describe locations and events
    - Detect patterns
    - Make predictions
    - Find paths & routes

- **Data visualization**
    - Conveying data (usually statistics) into graphics
    - Maps
    - Charts
    - Animations
