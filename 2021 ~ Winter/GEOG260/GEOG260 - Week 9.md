# GEOG260 - Week 9: Isolines, Topography, Contours

# Isorhythmic Lines, Isopleths, & Mapping
- **Isorhythmic map** = a map in which a set of isolines (lines of equal value) that are interpolated between points of known value (Ex: precipitation)

- **Isometric** = data occurring at points (true point data; data that is manually collected); in an isometric map point data is transformed into **lines**

- **Isopleth** = data occurring over geographic areas and is conceptual point data for relative values (comparative sets); in an isopleth map point data is transformed into **polygons**

- On topographic maps, everything **always** forms a **closed loop** (even if it is not visible on the map)

## Common Isoline Types
- Isohyet = precipitation
- Isospecie = density of species
- Isochrone = travel time from a given point
- Isodopane = cost of travel time
- Isobath = depth below sea level
- Isotherm = temperature
- Isobar = pressure
- **Isohypse = (contour) elevation above sea level; topography**

## Choropleth vs. Isopleth
- **Choropleth** = a map where data is assigned to a predetermined area (counties, states, etc.)
    - Administrative driven; conforming to administrative areas
- **Isopleth** = a map where data is overlaid on top of a region regardless of administrative boundaries
    - Data driven; letting data fall over a space rather than cramming data into a space, more precise and accurate to the actual data

## Isoline Maps
- **Advantages:**
    - Show gradual change over large areas
    - Lines join places of equal value
    - Use fixed interval
    - Can be black and white or in color
    - Fit well over "base maps"

- **Disadvantages:**
    - Shading can falsely imply values
    - Require a large amount of data; data intensive
    - Variation in the lines is possible (different interpretations of data can lead to variation in the end result)

# Contour Lines & Topographic Maps
- Contour lines are essentially isolines; join common points of data (elevation)

- **Topography** = the arrangement of the natural and artificial physical feature of an area
- **Topographic map** = a map detailing the arrangement of natural and artificial physical features of an area
    - Uses contour lines to indicate elevations
    - Sometimes made with shaded reliefs
    - How we communicate geomorphology

- **Geomorphology** = the study of the Earth's natural features
- **Landform analysis** = the study of terrain that comprises morphological features

- **Brown lines** = contour lines; all contour lines have an **index** and an **interval**
    - Index = number labeling the value of each contour line (Ex: "50", meaning that contour line has an elevation of 50)
    - Interval = actual space/difference between contour lines (Ex: between two indexes of "50" and "60", the interval is 10)
    - **Contour lines link points of the same value (elevation), and always form a closed loop**

- **Spaced lines** = gradual slope; **tight lines** = steep slope

- Small tick marks on lines indicate a **closed depression**

## Features of a Topographic Map
- **Hill/peak** = series of concentric shrinking rings packed moderately close together
- **River valley** = characterized by "pinched lines" that always point uphill/upstream (meaning water flows away from the pinch)
    - Contour lines crossing rivers form a v-shaped pattern pointing upstream
- **Gorge/fjord** = very deep but narrow valley, lines are very tightly packed because the landscape is incredibly steep and sheer (less gradual than valley)
- **Cliff/escarpment** = characterized by very tightly packed lines that indicate a drop-off after an area of flatter terrain (plateau, plains, etc.)
- **Spur** = outcrop of rock along a slope/ridge
- **Plateau** = large area of no elevation change
- **Saddle** = two mountains with a ridge/dip between them; looks like a saddle

## Topographic Color Standards
- **Black** = buildings, railways, power lines, geographical names, certain symbols, coordinates, precise elevations, border information, and surround information
- **Red** = paved roads, highway numbers, interchange exit numbers, certain symbols, names of major transportation routes, red tint for urban development
- **Orange** = unpaved roads and unclassified roads and streets
- **Brown** = contour lines, spot elevations, sand and eskers
- **Blue** = lakes, streams, falls, rapids, swamps and marshes, names of water bodies, magnetic declination, and universal transverse Mercator (UTM) grid information
- **Green** = wooded areas, orchards, and vineyards
- **Gray** = map reference information
- **Purple** = updates to the current by year of noted revision
