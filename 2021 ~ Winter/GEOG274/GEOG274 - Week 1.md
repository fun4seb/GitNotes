# GEOG274 - Week 1: Endogenic and Exogenic systems, geologic time scale, Anthropocene

# A Systems Approach
> Systems Theory ~ States that a system is any set of ordered, interrelated components and their attributes, linked by flows of energy and matter, as distinct from the surrounding environment outside the system

- Contains **elements/characteristics** which may be arranged in a series, or intermingled
	- May comprise any number of "sub-systems"

## Open & Closed Systems
- A **closed** system (Ex: fish tank) has no input or influence from any outside forces independent of it (rarely happens in the real world)
- An **open** system (Ex: lake) requires, and is constantly influenced by, **inputs from the outside**. Open systems also **produce outputs** which affect the environment around the
	- **Most systems are open**
	- The earth is comprised of a network of mainly open systems, taking input and producing output to constantly influence each other

# Mass & Energy
- Within Earth's systems, both **mass and energy** are stored and retrieved; energy is transformed from one type to another
	- **Mass** = a measure of the amount of matter in an object (M)
	- **Energy** = a capacity to change the motion of, or to do work on matter (J for Joule)

- Is Earth an open or closed system?
	- **In terms of energy**, the earth is an open system as energy enters and leaves over time
	- **In terms of matter**, the earth is a closed system as no substantial amounts of matter add or subtract itself from the system of earth

- **SI units:**
	- Length (L) - meter (m)
	- Mass (M) - kilogram (kg)
	- Time (t) - seconds (s)
	- Temperature - Kelvin (K), 0K = -273 C

- **Unit prefixes:**
	- Hecto (h)
	- Kilo (k)
	- Mega (M)
	- Giga (G)
	- Tera (T)
	- Peta (P)
	- Centi (c)
	- Milli (M)
	- Micro ()
	- Nano (n)

## Conservation of Mass and Energy
- **Law of equivalent exchange**
	- Mass is neither destroyed nor created
	- Energy is neither destroyed nor created

- Input - output = **storage change**
	- If positive the system will grow as it nets positive energy
	- If negative the system will shrink as it nets negative energy
	- If the inputs and outputs of the system are equal, the system is in **equilibrium**

# System Equilibrium
- A body is in **equilibrium** if the net force acting on the body is zero (no net change in the system)

- **Status equilibrium** (mechanical equilibrium) = motion stopped
- **Dynamic equilibrium** = When a previously steady-state system demonstrates a changing trend over time
	- **When a previously steady system undergoes changes due to growing external influences/disruptions (thresholds/tipping points)** that cause the system to correct and reinvent itself; most systems are constantly being influenced and transformed over time
	- Dynamic equilibrium can either be...
 		- Stable (a), if the system returns to initial state after disturbance (ball in a basin)
 		- Unstable (b), if the system does not return to initial state after disturbance (ball on a hill)
 		- Neutral (c), if the system remains in equilibrium after disturbance (ball on flat ground)

# Endogenic & Exogenic Systems
- **Endogenic system** = refers to the internal processes that produce flows of heat and material from beneath the Earth's crust
	- Energy source: heat from pressure (gravity) and radioactive decay

- **Exogenic systems** = refers to the external processes on Earth's surface that provide motion to air, water, and influence
	- Energy source: solar energy and the energy of motion (air, water, ice)

# Anthropocene
> Anthropocene ~ Geological epoch marking the start of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change

- **Anthropocene** = "the human epoch" 250 - 6000 years BP
	- Human activity affects the Earth's systems greater and faster than natural forces

# Geologic Time Scale
- Eon > Era > Period > Epoch (largest to smallest)
- Age of Earth: 4.567 billion years (Ga)
	- 88.3% of that time was spent in the Precambrian Eon

# Absolute vs. Relative Time
- **Absolute time:**
	- Actual number of years before present
	- Scientific methods (radiometric dating) determine absolute age

- **Relative time:**
	- Sequence of events; what happened in what order
	- Relative dating is based on the relative positions of **rock strata (layers)** above or below each other **(stratigraphy)**; older layers are always deeper, younger layers are always shallower

# Uniformitarianism & Superposition
- **Uniformitarianism:**
	- Idea that the same physical processes active in the environment today have been operating in the same manner for all of time (volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides, orogenesis)

- **Superposition:**
	- Concept that rock and sediment are always arranged with the youngest bed "superposed" toward the top of a rock formation and the oldest at the base, if they have not been disturbed

# Stratigraphy
- **Principles of stratigraphy:**
	1. **Original horizontality** = states that layers of sediment are deposited from bottom to top creating horizontal layers of rock
	2. **Lateral continuity** = states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions; in other words, they are laterally continuous. As a result, rocks that are otherwise similar, but are now separated by a valley or other erosional feature, can be assumed to be originally continuous
	3. **Superposition** = states that within a sequence of rock layers, those lower in the sequence are older than those found above
	4. **Cross-cutting relations** = states that geological features that cut across rocks must have formed after the rocks they cut through
	5. **Law of inclusions** = states that if a rock body (Rock B) contained fragments of another rock body (Rock A), it must be younger than the fragments of rock it contained. The intruding rock (Rock A) must have been there first to provide the fragments
	6. **Law of faunal Succession** = observation that sedimentary rock strata contain fossilized flora and fauna, and that these fossils succeed each other vertically in a specific, reliable order that can be identified over wide horizontal distances
