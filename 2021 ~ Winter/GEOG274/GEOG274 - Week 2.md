# GEOG274 - Week 2: Earth internal structure, energy, and tectonics

# Lecture Notes
- Earth's internal structure and energy: refers to the **endogenic system** (internal)
    - Energy source: heat from pressure (gravity) and radioactive decay

## Earth History & Origin
- The solar system (including Earth) is ~4.6 billion years old
- **Holocene** (present epoch) started ~11,500 years ago
- **Anthropocene** (time of human dominance) started ~250 years ago

## Our Galaxy
- The Sun is located about halfway between the center and periphery of the galaxy
- The galaxy is a **rotating** **disc** with a **bulge** at the center

- **Formation of our solar system:**
    - Solar systems develop when nebulae (cloud of dust and gas) begin to rotate and contract into a disc which condenses particles into rock matter, which collide and form together to create celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, sun, etc.)

- **Formation of planets:**
    - Clump of dust particles > planetesimals > proto-planets
    - After the repeated collision of particles, bigger particles called **planetesimals** form which grow bigger until planets form
    - As a planet forms the surface is in a liquid state due to the temperature however as the planet cools, gravity sorts the materials by density creating layers of rock

## Earth's Internal Structure
- **Earth's interior** = core, mantle, crust
    - Core: (1200+2200) km, 10-13.5 g/cm; separated by Bullen
    - Mantle: (~2900) km, 4-4.5 g/cm; separated by Gutenberg
    - Crust: (70+180) km, 2.7-3 g/cm; separated by Mohorovicic (at ~7-35 km)

- **Earth's density stratification:**
    - Each **discontinuity** (boundary between layers) is marked with a notable jump in density over very little space
    - Ex: **Core-Mantle-Boundary (CMB)** which separates the core and the mantle features a huge increase in density moving from the inner mantle to the outer core

### Core
- The core makes up 15% of the Earth's volume and 33% of its total mass (made of iron and some nickel)

- Divided between an **inner core** and an **outer core**, which are both separated by the **Bullen discontinuity**
    - Inner core = **solid iron**; ~1200 km thick, density of 13.5 g/cm
        - Despite being hotter than the melting point, the iron inner core is solid because of the Earth's **pressure** forcing it to stay in that state
    - Outer core = **liquid molten iron**; 2200 km thick, density of 10 g/cm
        - The fluid inner core **generates 90% of the Earth's magnetic field** because it is made of liquid molten metallic iron (thermal and gravitational energy is transformed into a magnetic field)

### Mantle
- The mantle is a layer of hot, but mostly **solid** material that makes up 84% of Earth's total volume
    - Composed of **iron, magnesium, silicates (silicon dioxide)**; this is where most of the world's oxygen is, trapped in silicon dioxide
- Separated from the core by the **Gutenberg discontinuity**

- Stratified by **density** (which is controlled by **temperature**)
- Ductile
- Heated by radioactive decay and core
- Rocks in the warmer and **less dense** inner mantle rise upward where they cool and become rigid as their heat is transfered to the outer mantle
    - As it cools, the density increases and the rocks begin to sink (convection currents)

- Divided between a **lower mantle** and an **upper mantle**
    - Lower mantle density: ~4.5 g/cm
    - Upper mantle density: ~4 g/cm

- **Three layers of the upper mantle:** upper mantle (rigid), asthenosphere (plastic), uppermost mantle (rigid)
    - **Asthenosphere** = a plastic-like layer (will slowly flow when a force is present) between the upper mantle and the uppermost mantle
    - **Lithosphere** = a rigid layer (will not flow when a force acts on it; instead will bend or break) which consists of the crust and the uppermost mantle

### Crust
- Outermost shell of the planet, making up 1% of the Earth's volume
- The uppermost mantle and the crust above is separated by a boundary called the **Mohorovicic discontinuity**

- Continental crust is thick, old, and light; ~2.7 g/cm (**SIAl**; stands for dominant elements of **silica** and **aluminum**)
- Oceanic crust is thin, young, and heavy; ~3 g/cm (**SiMa**; stand for dominant elements of **silica** and **magnesium**)

- **Two layers of the crust:** Continental crust (older), lithosphere (newer)

## Geomagnetism
- The flowing of **liquid metal in the outer core** of the planet generates electric currents. The rotation of Earth on its axis causes these electric currents to form a magnetic field which extends around the planet.
- **Geomagnetic reversal** = when the North and South polls switch
    - Occurs ~800,000 years on average; the last one was 790,000 years B.P. and the next one might be within ~1000 years

- Magnetic poles **do not equal** geographic poles
    - North magnetic pole is now 85 degrees N, 134 degrees W
