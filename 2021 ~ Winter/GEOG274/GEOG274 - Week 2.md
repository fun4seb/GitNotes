# GEOG274 - Week 2: Earth internal structure, energy, and tectonics

# Lecture Notes
- Earth's internal structure and energy: refers to the **endogenic system** (internal)
    - Energy source: heat from pressure (gravity) and radioactive decay

## Earth History & Origin
- The solar system (including Earth) is ~4.6 billion years old
- **Holocene** (present epoch) started ~11,500 years ago
- **Anthropocene** (time of human dominance) started ~250 years ago

## Our Galaxy
- The Sun is located about halfway between the center and periphery of the galaxy
- The galaxy is a **rotating** **disc** with a **bulge** at the center

- **Formation of our solar system:**
    - Solar systems develop when nebulas (cloud of dust and gas) begin to rotate and contract into a disc which condenses particles into rock matter, which collide and form together to create celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, sun, etc.)

- **Formation of planets:**
    - Clump of dust particles > planetesimals > proto-planets
    - After the repeated collision of particles, bigger particles called **planetesimals** form which grow bigger until planets form
    - As a planet forms the surface is in a liquid state due to the temperature however as the planet cools, gravity sorts the materials by density creating layers of rock

## Earth's Structure
- **Earth's interior** = core, mantle, crust

### Mantle
- Separated from the core by the **Gutenberg discontinuity**
- General: lower mantle + upper mantle
- Average depth is ~2900 km (80% of Earth's total volume)

- Lower mantle density: ~4.5 g/cm
- Upper mantle density: ~4 g/cm
    - **Three layers:** rigid upper mantle, asthenosphere, rigid uppermost mantle

- Layer of hot, but mostly **solid** material that represents 80% of Earth's total volume
    - Composed of **iron, magnesium, silicates (silicon dioxide)**; this is where most of the world's oxygen is, trapped in silicon dioxide
