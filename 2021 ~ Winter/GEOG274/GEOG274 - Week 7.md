# GEOG274 - Week 7: Fluvial and Aeolian Processes and Landforms, Erosion and Deposition

- **Hydrological cycle** = processes Earth materials with the chemical and physical action of water, ice, and wind (weathering, erosion)
    - **Materials** = water (Ex: precipitation), rocks (tectonic activity)
    - **Energy** = heat energy (solar radiation), kinetic energy (gravity, water and air movement)

- Water has similarities with the mass movement of rock on a slope, the differences are:
    1. Water may act as an **agent of weathering**; moving water digs into rock through **hydraulic action**
    2. The density of water is much less than rock; requires less energy to move

- **Hydraulic action** = erosion that occurs when the motion of water against a rock surface produces mechanical weathering; **ability for flowing water to dig into rock**
    - Hydraulic action is at a maximum **upstream** (more energy, turbulent flow)
    - In overland flow, water goes downslope in a thing film, a sheet-like flow, or by forming small **rills** (channels cut through hydraulic action)

# Fluvial Processes
- Erosion, transport, and deposition of a fluvial channel over land is controlled by the **volume of flow (discharge)** and **steepness (channel gradient)**

- **Fluvial process** = process by which water dislodges, dissolves, or removes (weathered) surface material (zone of sediment production). The material is then transported to new locations (zone of transportation), where it is later deposited (zone of deposition)
    - **Zone of sediment production (erosion) > zone of transportation > zone of deposition**

## Channel Gradient & Mean Velocity
- **Channel gradient** = gradient of the stream; defined by drop in elevation per unit of distance
    - Steep gradient = higher mean velocity
    - Low gradient = lower mean velocity
    - **Base level** = The level below which a stream cannot erode its valley
    - Sea level = ultimate base level

## Sediment Load
- **Sediment load** = sediment transported by flowing water
    - **Stream capacity** = measure of the total sediment a stream can carry

- **3 types of sediment load:**
    1. Dissolved load (solution; finest particles)
    2. Suspended load (fine grain particles)
    3. Bed load (coarser grain particles)

- **4 types of sediment motion:**
    1. Suspension
    2. Solution
    3. Saltation
    4. Traction
    - **Finer to coarser** = solution > suspension > saltation > traction
        - Finer sediments travel farther, with coarser (heavier) sediments traveling shorter distances along the bottom of the stream

## Stream Channels
- **Stream** = body of water that flows downslope along a clearly defined **natural passageway**
- **Channel** = the natural passageway through which streams flow; can be either **straight** or **meandering**
- The speed of sediment transport determines the shape and size of the stream channel (faster stream cut bigger channels to compensate)

- **Channel pattern (shape of stream)** depends on sediment load, stream gradient, and resistance to erosion
    - Streams on **horizontal plains** develop either **straight** or **meandering** channel patterns
    - Streams on **steep mountain ranges/headwaters** develop **straight** channel patterns
    - Streams on **gradual slopes** are develop **meandering** channel patterns

## Fluvial Landscapes
- Fluvial landscapes are created through the ongoing interaction between **erosion, transportation, and deposition** within a river system
    - Erosion = the process by which water dislodges, dissolves, or removes weathered surface material
    - Fluvial transport = material is transported to new location
    - Deposition = material settles down

- The location of maximum velocity within a meandering stream shifts between **eroding the bank** on the outside of the bend and depositing a **point bar** on the inside of the bend
    - **Point bar** = shallow area/beach on the inside of a stream's bend; created through deposition of sediment due to lower stream velocity on the inside of a stream's bend
    - **Undercut bank** = The deeper area on the outside of the bend has a higher stream velocity and thus more power to erode, leading to the bank being undercut and eroded by the fast water

### Drainage Basins & Drainage Divides
- **Drainage basin** = geographical area where surface water drains to one point (stream) due to bowl-like topography
    - Drainage basins are separated by **drainage divides** (high points surrounding basin)
    - **Interfluve** = area of high ground between two stream valleys

### Stream Order
- All water flows to the area of lowest elevation forming a stream or network of streams
- Drainage basis is the entire area drained by a stream and its network of tributaries is **ordered from headwaters to mouth**
    - **Headwaters** = the source of a stream; subset of drainage basin
    - More tributaries = higher order

### Common Drainage Patterns

- The arrangement of channels within a drainage basin is determined by climatic condition and the particular geology/topography of the region
    - **Dendritic** = like a tree; most common
    - **Trellis** = develops in dipping and folding areas
    - **Radial** = off a central peak
    - **Parallel** = steep slope (high velocity streams)
    - **Rectangular** = faulted and jointed landscapes
    - **Annular** = concentric patterns of rock strata guide stream courses
    - **Deranged** = disrupted surfaces (Ex: glaciated regions)

# Erosional & Depositional Fluvial Landforms
- The two major types of fluvial landforms are **erosional** and **depositional**
- **Erosional landforms** = sequential landforms (created over time) that develops after sediment is removed by erosion (Ex: canyon, v-shaped valley, plunge pool)

- **Depositional landforms** = sequential landforms created when sediment settles down
    - **Alluvium** = general term for unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, gravel, and minerals that are deposited by running water
    - The process of **fluvial deposition** occurs when a stream deposits alluvium, creating depositional landforms such as **bars (levees), floodplains, terraces and deltas**

## Alluvial Fans
- Cone-shaped (like a fan) deposits of fluvial sediments in arid/semi-arid areas; **mound of deposited sediment creates radial stream patterns**
- Produced when flowing water (Ex: flash flood) abruptly looses its velocity (Ex: as it leaves the constricted channel of a canyon)
- Commonly occur at the mouth of a canyon where an **ephemeral stream** channel exits the mountains into flatter terrain
    - **Ephemeral stream** = discontinuous stream flow

## Floodplains & Terraces
- **Floodplains & terraces** = the flat, low-lying areas adjacent to a channel and subjected to recurrent flooding
- flooded when the river overflows its channel due to times of high flow
- Receding water leaves behind either alluvial deposits that mask the underlying rock with their accumulating thickness **(floodplain)**, or cuts into the valley **(terrace)**

## Natural Levees (Sand Bars)
- Elongated ridge of course sediment deposited along stream due to repeated flooding

## River Deltas
- (Nearly) level depositional plain that forms at the **estuary** of a river where the river reaches its **base level**
    - The river's velocity rapidly decelerates as it enters a larger standing body of water; the reduced stream energy causes deposition of the sediment load, **this leads to the creation of land over time**
    - Coarse sand is deposited closer to the rivers mouth while finer materials are carried farther and form the extreme end of the deposit; extends with time

- If the delta exits with a **shortage of sediment to deposit** (due to being trapped at earlier points along the channel), **the flow will erode material rather than deposit it**, leading to the destruction of land (Ex: disappearing Mississippi delta)

## Coastal Processes & Landforms
- **Littoral zones** = coast area and shallow offshore environment, from the highest storm waterline to the line where sediments are unaffected by wave action (60 m depth)
    - Shaped by: waves and tide
    - Subject to: erosion and deposition

- **Erosional coastal landforms:**
    - Rugged, high relief, and tectonically active
    - Differential weathering
    - Wave action (cliffs, undercutting)
    - Subject to climate change and human impacts

- **Depositional coastal landforms:**
    - Form along land of gentle relief
    - Relatively passive and tectonically inactive
    - Subject to climate change and human impacts

### Wave refraction & Coastal Straightening
- Wave energy is **concentrated as it converges on headlands** and **diffused as it diverges in coves and bays**
- Different sections of the coastline receive different wave energy and thus vary in erosion potential (inlet bays are impacted by wave forces less than protruding features)
- The long-term effect of wave refraction is **straightening of the coast** (protruding features of the coast are weathered over time, being brought closer to the bay; straightening)

# Aeolian Processes
- **"Wind as an agent of geomorphic change"**
    - Deserts (tropical and polar) and coastal environments are shaped by wind
    - Particles that are transported by wind can be circulated globally; change on a large scale (Ex: dust from Africa contributing to soils in South America and Europe)

- **Aeolian** = "wind-related"
- Aeolian processes = erosion, transportation, deposition (fluid motion; similar to water)
- Wind has a **weaker ability to transport material** than water due to much lower viscosity and density

- **Grain Size and ease of transport:**
    - **Small** particles are difficult to move because they have a **mutual cohesiveness** and also present a smooth surface to the wind
    - **Intermediate** particles are easy to move because they can bounce along
    - **Large** particles are heavier and require stronger winds to move

## Aeolian Transport of Dust and Sand
- **Suspension**: occurs when grain size < 0.2 mm (dust = particles < 0.062 mm)
- **Saltation** (80% of motion): occurs when grain size > 0.2 mm (skipping and bouncing aerodynamic lift; elastic bounce impact = grains hit other grains and knock them into the air)
- **Surface creep** (20% of motion): occurs when grain size is too large for saltation; often pushed forward by saltating particles

## Erosional Aeolian Landforms
- Two main wind erosion processes: **deflation** and **abrasion**
    - **Deflation** = removal and lifting of individual looser particles (sand, dust, etc.) while leaving courser particles behind
    - **Abrasion** = erosion of rock surface through the "sandblasting" action of airborne particles; rate of abrasion is dependent on material of rock, wind speed, and wind consistency

- **Desert pavement** = 

## Depositional Aeolian Landforms
- Only 10% of desert areas are covered with sand
- Sand grains are typically deposited as transient ridges or hills (dunes)
- Sand dunes are formed by deposition and shaped by erosion, leading to **dune migration**
    - Over time, the ongoing process that transfers particles from the windward slope to the leeward slope causes the **entire slope to migrate downwind**
    - Angle of repose for sand is ~30-34 degrees (steepest angle at which sand particles are stable on a slope)

- The shape of dunes (Ex: crescent, linear, star) is dependent on the balance between the factors of **wind, sand, and vegetation**

### Loess Deposits
- **Loess deposits** = wind blown deposits of fine, unstable rocky material; concentrations of loess deposits globally are related to ancient glaciers

- 15,000-6,000 years ago, Pleistocene glaciers retreated and left behind **till** and large **glacial outwash (meltwater)** deposits of fine-grained **clays and silts**
- These materials were sometimes **blown great distances by the wind** and re-deposited in unstratified, homogeneous deposits; loess deposits
- **Silt** dominates in loess deposits

- **Loess deposits make fertile soil because:**
    - They are deep (lowland deposits can be over 300 m)
    - They are well drained (mix sized particles, silt dominant)
    - Excellent structural strength (clays = water retention)
    - (all characteristics of Earth's "breadbasket" farming regions)
