# Review Part I: The Persian Wars
- **Persian Empire**
    - Ancient near-east empire that corresponds to modern Iran
    - The ruling class/core population was formed by people who arrived in the Iranian Plateau (circa 1000 BC; following bronze age collapse)
    - Indo-European speaking people; Aramaic developed into main language of the empire
    - The empire was well connected for its time; extensive road network
    - Began as purely land-based power, however by the Classical period they were also a formidable naval power

- **Universal Empire**
    - Term that refers to the political approach of the Persians; very different from the harsh assimilation policy of other ancient civilization
    - Local cultures and religions are preserved/adopted by the Persians
    - Tribute/obedience is required by subjects but assimilation is not

- **Zoroastrianism**
    - State religion of Persian Empire
    - Founded by a prophet named **"Zoroaster"**
    - Based on the dichotomy between **Ahuramazda** (representing light, truth, good) and **Ahriman** (representing dark, lies, evil)
    - Concerned with spreading truth and defeating darkness; ideological justification for the role of a king, as well as the expansion of Persia through conquest

- **Behustan Inscription**
    - Constructed by Darius the Great and named for the mountainous site it is located; A relief cut into a live rock face
    - Inscribed on the relief is text given in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian
    - Describes the deeds of Darius I (takeover of Persia), and also describes Darius as a divinely mandated ruler

- **Satrap/Satrapy**
    - A **Satrapy** is a region/province within Persia, while a **satrap** is the chief magistrate (governor) of said province

- **Cyrus the Great**
    - Succeeds as king of Anshan in the sixth century BC
    - Takes advantage of weak political rulers and comes to control Media, Lydia, and topples the Neo-Babylonian empire
    - Founds the Achaemenid Persian empire, growing to encompass nearly all of the near-east
    - Later dies on campaign against the Scythians

- **Achaemenid Dynasty**
    - Dynasty that began before the time of Cyrus and continued to rule Persia after his death

- **Herodotus**
    - Greek historian who lived in 484-425 BC
    - Wrote **"The Histories"**; his goal is to trace the root causes of the Persian war
    - Our main source during the Persian war period
    - His work is not considered completely authoritative because he includes personal bias, commentary, opinions, as well as material included for entertainment purposes
    - Sometimes called the "father of history" because he is the first Greek writer of history
    - Rejects mythological explanations and tries to access the closes sources, often includes first-hand testimony
    - Another goal of his is to preserve the human achievement of both Greeks and Barbarians
    - A flaw with his work is that he sometimes blurs the boundary between fact and myth, placing speeches of his own writing into the mouths of leaders, as well as being uncritical of the sources he takes at face value

- **Darius I**
    - Takes the Persian throne after a power struggle in the fifth century BC
    - Not a direct heir of Cyrus however he is an Achaemenid
    - He reforms and expands the Persian empire, being seen as a successful ruler; notable because he constructed the "royal road" from Susa to Sardis

- **First Persian War (492-490 BC)**
    - The key events of the first Persian war include:
        1. **The Ionian Revolt (499-494 BC)**; precursor to the First Persian War
            - Ionia is the region settled by Greek speaking people on the West coast of Asian Minor on the Aegean sea; at this time Ionia is ruled by Persia
            - Causes of the revolt include discontent with Persian rule and local government, and restrictions on economic freedom (freedom to trade)
            - The Ionian Greeks band together and sack the city of Sardis (498 BC), after this the Persians send reinforcements and defeat the Ionian Greeks as well as launching a campaign to stamp out the rest of the revolts
            - A decisive battle takes place at Lade (494 BC), and the Persians end the conflict by buying off Greek coalition members until the coalition is small enough to easily deal with
            - Finally the city of Miletos (central to the rebellion) is destroyed by the Persians (494 BC)
        2. **The Expedition of Mardonius (492 BC)**
            - Mardonius is a Persian noble and key general, serving in both the first and second Persian War
            - Majority of the naval force under Mardonius sinks off the coast of Mt. Athos Peninsula in a storm, however the land force is successful in making it to Greece and results in territorial gains for Persia in Macedonia
        3. **The Battle of Marathon (490 BC)**
            - The Persians raise another naval force after the first one is destroyed and cross the center of the Aegean and land at Eretria, destroying the area
            - Following this Greek and Persian forces meet at Marathon (in Attica), the Greek forces are comprised solely of Athens and Plataea (Sparta fails to answer the call to action due to a religious festival)
            - The Greek strategy was to thin out their battle line and concentrate the strength of their troops towards the flanks. As the Persians engaged the troops at the center, the flanks wrapped around the sides and encircled the Persian troops leading to victory for the Greeks despite their smaller army, thus ending the First Persian War

- **Aristagoras of Miletos**
    - Becomes leader of Miletos and ends the tyrannical Persian government and establishes a democracy
    - Responsible for bringing together the Ionian cities into a coalition, leading to the Ionian revolt; **ringleader of the Ionian revolt**
    - Convinces Athens and Eretria to become allies and invades Persian territory, eventually defeated by Persia in Thrace

- **Miltiades**
    - Chosen Greek commander at Marathon; credited by Herodotus with coming up with the battle plan to encircle the Persians
    - His battle plan won out over other competing options posed by other commanders

- **Callimachus**
    - The Greek war-leader at the time of the Battle of Marathon and supported Miltiades' plan to defeat the Persians

- **Painted Stoa**
    - Building in Athens
    - A **"stoa"** is a series of columns connected together by a roof structure
    - Inside the painted stoa was a series of paintings depicting both mythic scenes and historical battle scenes (battle of Marathon) 
    - Example of a trend in the classical period where there was a shift in art towards the depiction of historical events rather than just mythological events; result of the cultural impact that the battle of Marathon had on Greek society

- **Persian Army**
    - The Persians used three classes of troops:
        1. **Light-armed troops**; rushed in and used projectiles such as bows and slings
        2. **Heavy-armed troops**; meant to engage in hand-to-hand combat
        3. **Cavalry troops**; used for flanking and charging
    - The Persians also used a lot of levied troops, meaning they rallied troops from their subjects and fought using their own arms and armor
    - The general Persian tactic was to attack with projectiles first, then the infantry would engage as the cavalry flanked enemies and picked off stranglers and retreating enemies

- **Greek Army**
    - Very different from the Persian army in that they only used one type of troop, that being the **"hoplite"**; homogeneous army
    - Hoplites were citizen farmers, and were named for their shield (hoplon)
    - All hoplites used the same mix of arms and armor; **panopoly of arms**
        - **The panopoly of arms included:** a shield, 2 spears, a helmet, greaves, breastplate, and sometimes a sword
    - Fighting was done in a disciplined formation known as a **"phalanx"** where each shield held by a hoplite covers half of their body and half of their neighbors' body creating an interlocking shield wall

- **Silver Mines of Laurion**
    - Mass of silver ore deposit discovered in southern Attica sometime after the battle of Marathon

- **Themistocles**
    - Athenian general; proposed that Athens use the wealth from the silver mines of Laurion to construct a fleet of triremes
        - He is pro-democracy, anti-Sparta, anti-Persian, and pro-Athenian empire
    - Before this Athens was NOT a naval power however this helped to transform them into one
    
- **Wooden walls**
    - Metaphor for the hulls of the ships that Themistocles proposed to be built by Athens
    - After conversing with an oracle about what to do about the Persian threat they advise to "hide behind wooden walls"; **the newly constructed triremes are these "wooden walls"**

- **Xerxes I**
    - Son of Darius I; succeeds his father in the fifth century BC
    - Takes on his father's legacy to invade Greece and initiates the Second Persian War
    - His campaigns are fewer and more carefully planned compared to his father; Ex: constructs canal through Mt Athos peninsula to avoid Greek forces, also organizes a bridge of boats for his army to cross from Asia Minor into Europe over the Hellespont (narrow straight of sea between Asia Minor and Thrace)

- **Hellenic League**
    - Formed in 481 BC; Greeks band together to defeat the Persians during the Second Persian War
    - Comprised of 31 city states out of hundreds; small portion of total Greek states
    - Sparta insists on having military command of the league

- **Medizers**
    - Derogatory term used by Greeks against other Greeks; especially used by Athenians
    - Describes Greeks that submitted to the Persians when they heard of Xerxes' oncoming expedition (because they knew they could not resist); such Greeks were looked down upon during and after the war for their submission

- **Second Persian War (480-479 BC)**
    - The Persian force was much larger compared to that of the First Persian War; some Greek mercenaries fight alongside the Persian troops
    - Key events of the Second Persian War include:
        1. **Battle of Thermopylae**
            - Thermopylae means "hot gates"; narrow pass connecting central and southern Greece
            - Generals of Hellenic league decide to take a stand at this pass to prevent invasion into lower Greek mainland
            - The Greek forces include: 4000 Peloponnesian troops, 300 Spartans, 1100 local troops; all commanded by Leonidas, the Spartan king at the time
            - The confined space of the hot gates aided the Greeks as it forced the larger Persian force to only engage in small waves
            - The Greeks hold the hot gates for several days until the Persians are able to circumvent them by utilizing a small pass, when the Greeks realize this Leonidas commands everyone to retreat while the remaining 300 Spartans (and some local troops) cover the retreat until they are eventually overrun by the Persians and die heroically 
        2. **Battle of Artemisium**
            - Persian fleet is engaged by the Athenian navy in a narrow straight north of Euboea
            - Battle is inconclusive; neither side takes significant losses
            - Part of the Persian fleet is wrecked in a storm during the night after the battle
        3. **First Sack of Athens (480 BC)**
            - After the defeat at Thermopylae the Persians march south towards Attica
            - The Hellenic league decides to the retreat to the Isthmus of Corinth (land bridge connecting Athens to the Peloponnese); Athens is evacuated and sacked by the Persian Army
            - This destruction is important because it marks an "archaeological horizon", dividing the Archaic and Classical period; the start of the Classical period is marked by this destruction
            - The debris created by the Persians creates a clear indication in the material evidence that can be tied to this dated event event
                - The material evidence lying below the debris can be labeled as Archaic (before the destruction), while the material evidence deposited above the debris can be labeled as Classical (after the destruction)
        4. **Battle of Salamis**
            - After the Battle of Artemisium the Persian navy heads towards Salamis after tracking the Greek fleet
            - The Persian navy doesn't engage at first but Themistocles sends a message to the Persians that many Greeks are planning to desert during the night (a lie); this results in the Persian fleet falling for the trick and spending the whole night blocking escape routes tiring them out
            - By the next day the Persian rowers are tired from holding a position all night and despite the Greeks having a smaller fleet, they are better rested and prepared and defeat the Persian fleet in the narrow straight of Salamis
            - The battle resulted in a heavy loss of the Persian fleet, reducing the fleet so that it can no longer support the supply lines necessary to continue the war, effectively grinding their campaign against the Greeks to a halt
            - After the battle Xerxes retreats back to Persia while the Persian general Mardonius marches the rest of the troops to spend the winter just outside Greece
        5. **Second Sack of Athens**
            - After the Battle of Salamis the Persian general Mardonius makes an offer to Athens that if they turn against Sparta then Persia will help rebuild the city and grant Athens autonomy
                - The Persian goal at this time was to extract their troops by sea back to Persia but they need the Athenian navy to stand down to accomplish this
            - Athens refuses the proposal resulting in Mardonius sacking the city again and occupying it
        5. **Battle of Plataea (479 BC)**
            - After the second sack of Athens, the Spartans come to the Athenians aid
            - Mardonius takes a fortified position near Plataea
            - The Greek strategy is to disadvantage the Persian cavalry by forcing them to fight in the hills (where horses have trouble charging and maneuvering)
            - After the Persians refuse to enter the hills, there is an initial skirmish and the Persians end up pursuing the withdrawing Greeks where they are later reengaged and slaughtered by the Greeks and Mardonius is killed
            - The Persian defeat marked the end of the Persian campaign into Greece during the Second Persian War
        6. **Battle of Mycale**

- **Triremes & Athenian Navy**
    - Main vessel of the Athenian navy is the **trireme**
    - Triremes used three banks of rowers and sometimes held a hoplite marine force to defend the ship
    - The trireme also had to be beached at the end of each day to prevent rot and keep them dry and maneuverable
    - Triremes were used in mainly coastal waters and were equipped with a bronze ram at the front of the ship that was used to punch a hole in enemy ships
    - Main strategy was to outmaneuver the enemy ships, ramming them from the side in order to sink them

- **First Sicilian War**
    - Conflict involving Sicilian Greek cities and the Phoenicians 
    - Key events of the First Sicilian War include:
        1. **Battle of Himera (480 BC)**
            - Allied Greek states defeat the Phoenicians who were led by Hamilcar (Phoenician noble and general)
        2. **Battle of Cumae (474 BC)**
            - Greek colony of Syracuse comes to the aid of Cumae (Greek colony on the mainland) against invading Etruscans (sophisticated iron-age culture of Italy)
            - The victory at Cumae means the entire Greek world is at peace for the first time since the Persian conflict started

# Review Part II: Pentacontaetia
- **Pentacontaetia**
    - Period of stability and peace between the end of the Persian Wars and the start of the Peloponnesian Wars
    - The fifty years of peace ends in 431 BC when war breaks out between Athens and Sparta
    - Key events include:
        - **Formation of the Delian League**
        - **Peace of Callias**
        - **Invasion of Attica by the Peloponnesian League**
        - **Thirty Years Peace**

- **Long Walls of Athens**
    - After the end of the Persian Wars, Athens began construction of a wall to surround all of Athens and **Piraeus** (Athen's port city)
    - Sparta opposes the building of the walls and Athens uses delay tactics to quickly build the walls using rubble while they are pretending to negotiate with Sparta
    - After the walls are completed it completely surrounded the city, as well as Piraeus, transforming Athens into a coastal fortress

- **Delian League**
    - Formed in 478 BC; Greek states created a coalition after the Persian wars with the goal of preventing further Persian activity in the Aegean region
    - **Main goals of the Delian League:**
        - Defend against the Persian threat
        - Maintain the liberty of Ionian cities
        - Secure the grain route to the Black Sea
    - The older Hellenic League was the predecessor to the Delian League; the new league was created after many states became unhappy with the Hellenic league after the Spartan leadership under **Pausanias** appeared to sympathize with the Persians
    - **Key differences between the Hellenic League and the Delian League:**
        - Most initial members of the Delian League are Ionian city states
        - The Delian League has a much tighter control over its members by the leader (Athens)
        - Athens and Sparta rivaled each other's power in the Hellenic League while in the Delian League Athens is the dominant force
    - The treasury and headquarters of the Delian League are located on the island of **Delos**; all member states were forced to contribute large amounts of silver to the common treasury; league funds were controlled by **Hellenotamiai** (treasurers) who were appointed by Athens
        - Athens is thus in control of the league from both a financial and military standpoint
        - Over time as the Persian threat dwindles it becomes clear that the Delian league grew to closely resemble a protection racket where smaller states were forced to contribute to the treasury or else face punishment by Athens
    - Majority of the Greek navy after the Persian wars were Athenian; Athens becomes the **hegemon/leader** of the Delian League
    - Sparta refuses to join the Delian League and instead forms its own league called the **Pelopennesian League**, comprised of the states of the Peloponnese mainland

- **Cimon**
    - Athenian general and statesmen; anti-Persian, pro-Spartan, and pro-empire
    - He aggressively pursued Athenian interests as the head of the Delian league, some of his actions conformed to the mandate of the league and some are purely in the Athenian interest; He targets Persians, pirates, and rebellious Greeks
    - His key naval campaigns were in Ion (pushed out Persians), Syros (removes pirate base), Aarystos (takes revenge on Greek medizers), and Naxos (destroys the people for trying to leave the Delian League)
    - Cimon is the Athenian **proxenos** (ambassador) to Sparta
    - He is eventually ostracized after his humiliation at Mt. Ithome (rallied Athens to assist Sparta with a Helot revolt however was dismissed by his "friends" after failing to siege the mountain)

- **Battle of Eurymedon (466 BC)**
    - Cimon leads the Delian league forces against Persia
    - Naval and land battle that takes place in Asia Minor; Greeks are the aggressors
    - Resulted in decisive Greek victory, marked the end of Persian military presence in Asia Minor

- **Peace of Callias**
    - Initiated in 465 BC, renewed in 449 BC
    - Many details are unknown but it marked the end of Greek and Persian hostility
    - Not a formal peace treaty, but rather an agreement where Greek and Persia agree to respect each other's spheres of influence

- **Third Messenian War**
    - After an earthquake in the Peloponnese, the Helots take the opportunity to revolt against the Spartans
    - The Spartans are forced to besiege the Helots who take a position on Mt. Ithome; the Spartans were unable to siege them, showing the weakness of Spartan siege tactics
    - Cimon convinces the Athenians (respected for their sieging ability) to send a force to aid the Spartan siege however the Spartans eventually send the Athenians back home; the whole situation was very embarrassing for Athens and as a result Cimon is ostracized

- **Athenian Empire**
    - Empire begins at 454 BC, marked by the moving of the Delian League treasury from Delos to Athens
        - With this action the Delian League is transformed into a collection of states that are subjected to the domination of the Athenians
    - **Athens uses a variety of methods to maintain control over the other states:**
        - Maintaining military garrisons in subject cities
        - Stalling Athenian governors and inspectors (Episkopoi) in subject cities
        - Use of cleruchies (spy networks sending intelligence to Athens)
        - Used proxenos (state diplomats/ambassadors) in subject states
        - Created religious ties with states by sending and receiving delegates from each state to participate in religious festivals
    - Athens had two important religious festivals:
        - City Dionysia, an urban theatrical festival
        - Panathenaea, athletic festival similar to the Olympics
    - Athens supported democratic governments and created a legal right that criminal trials of Athenians were only to take place in Athens
    - Another imperial control tactic used by Athens was the **coinage degree** (law issued by Athens in 450 BC that forced members of the Delian league/Athenian empire to only use Athenian currency); This ensured that Athens would become the central economic hub for all subject states because it forced states to exchange with Athens in order to obtain currency
        - Athenian coins included: **obol, drachma, tetradrachm**

- **Athenian Tribute List**
    - Important historical document that held details about the Athenian empire
    - It named the tax districts of the empire as well as the amounts payed
    - All members were obligated to pay tribute to Athens, most in the form of coin or precious metals however Chios, Lesbos, and Samos who chose to pay tribute in the form of ships
    - Changes in the tribute list over time tells us about changes in the political situation of the empire

- **Thirty Years Peace**
    - Agreed in 446 BC
    - The peace ended warfare between Sparta and Athens after they both became entangled in a series of minor conflicts between allies that are considered as precursors to the Pelopennesian War; after the peace Athens was forced to give up all possessions in the Peloponnese
    - These conflicts that lead up to the Thirty Years Peace include:
        - **Battle of Tanagra**
            - Ends in a draw
        - **Battle of Oenophyta**
            - Athens wins and takes control of of Boeotia
        - **Battle of Coronea**
            - Athens loses against an alliance of rebel states and forfeits a considerable amount of territory
    - The Thirty Years Peace lasted only fifteen years and ended after the Spartans declared war on the Athenians after the Athenians repeated undermined and violated the treaty by meddling with Sparta's allied states, thus beginning the Peloponnesian War

- **Pericles**
    - Greek statesmen during the golden age of Athens when the city was at its wealthiest during a time of social and cultural achievement
    - Under Pericles the **Athenian Citizenship Law** was introduced that required people to only be considered Athenian citizens if both their parents were Athenian citizens; the idea is to control the group of people who were allowed to be citizens and to prevent people from losing their place in society
    - Pericles also introduced a **salary for jurors** (2 obols per day) that allowed poorer citizens to participate in jury trials where before only those rich enough to not work could participate; step towards true democracy
    - Led the **Periclean Building Program** that saw the construction of many important monuments around the acropolis at the time of Athen's height, such buildings include:
        - Parthenon
            - Monument to Athenian victory and empire, contained the treasury of the Delian League after it was moved to Athens
            - Expensive building; made with luxurious materials (marble, etc.)
            - It was decorated with a variety of scenes that showcased Athenian victories
            - Contained a very large **chryselephantine** (artwork made of ivory and gold) statue of Athena
        - Erechtheion
        - Propylaea
        - Temple of Athena Nike

- **Radical Athenian Democracy**
    - Form of democracy practiced during the Athenian Empire that encouraged all citizens to participate in the democratic process and decision making of the state

- **Reforms of Ephialtes (461 BC)**
    - Ephialtes is an Athenian aristocrat and politician who rose to influence in the absence of Cimon
    - Introduced reforms that increased the role of the populace in city politics
    - The reforms were partly due to pressure introduced by the rising importance of navy rowers in Athenian society that were demanding a share of power
    - **Reforms under Ephialtes include:**
        - The **Areopagus** was derived of all power and authority (except over murder trials), while the **Boule** and **Ekklasia** were allocated the majority of the political power 
            - **Areopagus** = council of former archons; oligarchical/aristocratic and undemocratic
            - **Boule** = council of 500 tribes that proposes bills for the Ekklasia
            - **Ekklasia** = popular assembly comprised of the citizens of Athens that after the reforms was responsible for Athen's decision making
            - **Kleroterion** = stone slab with slots that held tokens used to randomly select the members of the Boule
        - The minimum wealth class was increased so that more people could qualify for archonship
        - Jurors received a salary, allowing poor citizens to participate in trials rather than just rich citizens who could afford not to work
        - Many official positions also become salaried so that poor citizens may hold prominent positions in office

- **Athenian Jury Courts**
    - Athenian jury courts did not use lawyers or judges and instead were comprised of **300-500 citizens** (the jury was so big to prevent bribery)
    - Jury was chosen by lot and voting was done using disk ballots
    - If the defendant was found guilty each side would propose a punishment and a second vote would be cast to decide between the two punishments
    - Some court decisions revealed the fickleness of the court as decisions were not constant from trial to trial and depended on the jury; no legal consistency
        - Because of this **rhetoric** becomes a powerful tool as the ability to use speech to influence juries allows skilled individuals to set policy and influence criminal trials
    - A **klepsydra** is a water-clock used to measure the length of a speech in court; allowed for a fair allocation of time to each speaker

- **Liturgies**
    - Liturgies are ways wealthy Athenians could gain prestige, considered an honor and a chance to flaunt ones wealth
    - **Some Liturgies include:**
        - **Trierarchia** = to sponsor a trireme for a year, including all its expenses and salaries of the crew
        - **Choragia** = to sponsor a dramatic festival
        - **Gymnasiarchia** = to sponsor an athletic competition
        - **Hestiasis** = to sponsor a public feast
        - **Architecheoria** = to sponsor a delegation to a religious festival outside Athens

- **Metics**
    - Metics are resident foreigners staying for more than a short period in Athens (semi-permanent residents without citizenship)
    - **Restrictions/rules of metics:**
        - Metics require a sponsor who is a citizen
        - They must pay a metic tax
        - They have to be registered
        - Metics Couldn't vote, hold land or office, serve in juries, or marry a citizen
        - Metics were obligated to perform military service
    - Freed slaves or descendants of slaves often lived under metic status
    - A large amount of people came to live in Athens under metic status; metics were a considerable demographic in Athenian society    

# Review Part III: Peloponnesian War
- **Thucydides (~460-400 BC)**
    - Lived through the Peloponnesian war and wrote a first-hand account of the events
        - Our main source during the Peloponnesian War (as well as the Pentacontaetia)
    - His account suggests that the Peloponnesian War was an inevitable result of the political situation at the time
    - He is much more sympathetic towards the Athenian side and is very supportive of Pericles; biased perspective

- **Aitiai**
    - **Aitiai = "causes of concern"**; there are several identified by Thucydides
    - The Aitiai basically mean the key catalytic events instigated by Athens that lead to conflict (Peloponnesian War)
    - Aitiai identified by Thucydides include:
        - **Megarian Decree**
            - The merchants of Megara were banned from all Athenian ports by Athens, causing their trading potential to be severely limited
            - Though unclear why Athens did this the decree resulted in increased political tension between Megara and its trading partners
        - **Corcyra Affair**
            - Conflict between Athens and Corinth that resulted after Athens send aid to **Corcyra**, a colony of Corinth, who was at war with their mother-city
            - By Athens getting entangled in the conflict between Corinth and Corcyra they **break the Thirty Years Peace** and show that Athens is acting pragmatically in its own interest rather than doing what is just (remaining impartial) 
        - **Destabilization of Poteidaia**
            - Poteidaia is a Corinthian colony and member of the Delian League
            - Athens requests that Poteidaia tear down its walls and cut ties with their mother-city of Corinth
            - In 432 BC, rebellion breaks out at Poteidaia and comes to involve the entire region
        - **Aegina**
