# HIST223 - Week 12: Second Athenian League/Theban War & Theban Hegemony

# Lecture Notes: Second Athenian League/Theban War

## Spartan Activity after the King's Peace
- Following the King's Peace, Sparta abuses the autonomy clause and argues that other states cannot organize themselves into leagues **(synoikism)** as this interferes with their status as independent polis
    - Sparta breaks up the **sympoliteia of Corinth and Argos** as well as the **Boeotian League**; Sparta is stopping other states from organizing in order to ensure their dominance 

- Sparta continues to engage in **dioikism** (dismantling of political organizations into its constituent parts; opposite of synoikism) 

### Spartan Occupation of Thebes
- The members of the Chalcidian League in Northern Greece attempted to gain autonomy from **Olynthos**, resulting in Sparta marching north across Greece to enforce the state's push for autonomy
    - Along the way Spartan forces get embroiled in a conflict at Thebes were they are persuaded by **Leontiades** (leader of a pro-Spartan faction) to occupy the **Kadmeia** (citadel) in the acropolis of Thebes, **clearly breaking the King's Peace**

- While Spartan forces are busy occupying the citadel at Thebes, Athens takes the opportunity to accumulate new allies and grow in power, starting with the island of **Chios**
    - Athens' alliances will eventually grow to form the **Second Athenian League**

- Theban exiles that were residing in Athens at the time of Sparta's occupation were supported by the Athenians to try and take back Thebes; **Theban counter-coup (379/8 BC)**
    - The Theban counter-coup is successful and the Theban exiles expel the Spartans from the Kadmeia

### Spartan Raid on Piraeus
- The Spartans respond to the counter-coup at Thebes by **raiding Piraeus (378 BC)**, causing Athens to declare war against Sparta
    - The clear problem causing these conflicts is that military commanders are acting without orders from their leaders and are thus jeopardizing the fate of other polis (Ex: by occupying Thebes and defying the King's Peace)

- As Athens feels that Sparta is no longer held to the standards set by the King's Peace, they disregard the rules as well and form the **Second Athenian League (378 BC)**

## Formation of the Second Athenian League [378 BC]
- in the **Prospectus of the Second Athenian League**, Aristoteles proposes that the Spartans should allow the Greeks to be free and autonomous, and invites any Greeks to join their League freely

- The League is intended to be a **defensive alliance** to rival Sparta and keep the King's Peace; Athens is careful to appease Persia

## Theban War [378-371 BC]
- Both Thebes and Athens are allies as they have a **common enemy of Sparta**
- The war begins with Sparta launching a raid on a Theban garrison at **Thespiai** which fails, prompting Thebes to start rebuilding its league **(Boeotian League)**
- As the war progress the Spartans attempt a variety of tactics however ultimately the war drags on for a few years 

### Battle of Leuctra [371 BC]
- The Boeotian League defeats Sparta under the command of **Epaminondas** (Theban strategist) who utilizes the **echelon formation** to break the Spartan battle line and kill the Spartan king, claiming a decisive victory

- Marks the end of Spartan hegemony in Greece
    - Situation in Sparta where there are very few full Spartiates left (<1000) and as a result of a dwindling population Sparta is unable to regain the power which it once had

## Hegemony vs. Common Peace
- Under **hegemony**, a dominant power guarantees peace among its dependent allies
    - The only problem is that no single polis is strong enough to enforce its hegemony, leading other competing powers to challenge the hegemony and demand a **common peace**

- Under a **common peace**, freedom and autonomy is guaranteed for all polis; system of collective security, like the United Nations
    - The problem with this is that it never works very well as there is no means in which to enforce and uphold the common peace (Ex: Sparta's activity during the King's Peace)

- What results is **repeating cycle between hegemony and common peace**
    1. A certain polis becomes power enough to dominate others and establish a hegemony
    2. however, it is not powerful enough to meaningfully maintain itself as it is challenged by rival powers causing a common peace to be enforced
    3. But only until a single power within it becomes powerful enough to once again establish a hegemony and repeat the process

# Lecture Notes: Theban Hegemony [371-362 BC]
- Following the Theban War there are **three main powers that are dominant in Greece:**
    1. Thebes and its allies
    2. Athens and its allies
    3. Sparta and its allies

- The Greek world is caught in a cycle: **common peace > abuse > hegemony > war > repeat**
    - This cycle will continue to repeat, until **Philip of Macedon** breaks it

## Epaminondas & Pelopidas
- Important figures who meet in 384 BC and **reorganize the Theban military**

- **Epaminondas** is known as the **greatest Greek commander**
    - Invents the **Echelon formation** in which units are arranged diagonally to cover all other units; **the strongest units were located at the left of the battle line and bolstered with other troops** to engage and crush the enemy's strongest units who were arranged in a more traditional battle formation and expecting to face off against weaker opponents on the left of the Theban battle line

- **Pelopidas** is a member of the democratic faction in Thebes who eventually goes into exile at Athens where he plots to get Thebans to attack Athens until he returns to Thebes
    - When Pelopidas returns to Thebes he forms the **Theban Sacred Band** (group of 300 who are the best of the Theban troops)
    - Pelopidas also **captures Philip of Macedon** during a northern campaign; this event will have later ramifications
    - Pelopidas later dies in battle

## Theban Hegemony
- The Battle of Leuctra resulted in the end of Spartan hegemony and the start of **Theban hegemony**

- Thebes attempts to persuade Athens to join their fight against Sparta after the Battle of Leuctra however they are reluctant to join and Thebes is content to march against Sparta alone
    - Thebes leads an expedition into the southern Peloponnese and **liberates the helots of Messenia** (further contributing to the downfall of the Spartan population as they depend heavily on their helot population)

- **Stasis** = civil war (between factions) within a polis; occurred in previously pro-Spartan cities as Sparta's hegemony falls

- In 366 BC, The King's Peace is renewed a **third time**
    - Boeotia and Messenia join the peace however Sparta does not meaning Thebes is free to continue fighting Sparta
    - **Sparta looks Athens for an alliance** against Thebes as they are now the dominant threat within Greece

- At the same time that Epaminondas is leading the expedition south to liberate Messenia, **Pelopidas leads an expedition to the north** where he gains allies on the way to Macedon where he **captures Philip II of Macedon**, taking him prisoner back to Thebes
    - While a prisoner, Philip II studies the Theban military tactics and improves on them when he later returns to Macedon, much to the later detriment of the Thebans
    - **Pelopidas' expedition ends in Macedon when he is killed at the battle of Cynoscephalae**

- The Thebans make an effort to build up their naval fleet, however despite being financed by the Persians their rowers are inferior to the more experienced Athenian rowers and they make no significant gains with their fleet; Thebans depend on their land-forces due to their weak navy

- After Pelopidas' death, Epaminondas leads a second expedition south that results in the **Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)**; much less successful
    - Thebans and their allies vs. Sparta and Athens and their allies
    - The Battle of Mantinea is indecisive; despite the Thebans technically claiming victory, **Epaminondas dies in the process and the Thebans are left without leadership**
    - The lack of leadership results in a **power vacuum** within Greece that is later filled by **Philip II of Macedon** as he invades Greece
