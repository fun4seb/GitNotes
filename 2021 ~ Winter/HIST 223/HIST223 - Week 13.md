# HIST223 - Week 13: Philip of Macedon, Sacred Wars/Philip's Conquest

# Lecture Notes: Philip of Macedon
- Following the Battle of Mantinea, Thebes is left without the powerful leadership of Pelopidas and Epaminondas
    - Unable to fill the void left by their military leaders, and without the resources to rebuild, **a power vacuum forms in the Greek world which is later filled by Philip II of Macedon**

## Macedon
- "Macedonia" means different things at different times; historically shifting boarders

- **Are the Macedonians Greek?**   
    - Macedonians share some aspects of Greek culture: speak a dialect of Greek, have a similar religion
    - Considered more/less Greek depending on the time period; By the classical period there is a perception of Macedonians as "half-barbarian"/ the unsophisticated cousins of Greeks

- Macedonia is less urbanized than the rest of the Greek world, however very fertile (good for livestock and lumber)
- Macedonia also features prominent mountainous areas that were hard to control and allowed for enemy forces to the north to pose a threat to the lowland areas

### Organization of Macedon
- Feudal kingdom; not as urbanized as other parts of the Greek world
- There is no written constitution
- Organization of power is based around having support from the aristocracy
- Members at court known as **hetairoi** (companions); elite cavalry of the Macedonian army

### The Argead Dynasty
- The core territory of Macedonia under Philip's control is also the ancestral home of the **Argead Dynasty** (Philip II's family)

- Alexander I wanted to compete in the Olympics and there was an argument about whether Macedonians were allowed to complete however because the Argeads trace their lineage back to Heracles they argued that they were indeed Greek and thus allowed to compete

### 5th Century Mythic Genealogy
- Mythic story that the great Greek ancestor **Hellen** had three sons: **Aiolos (Aeolian), Doros (Dorian), and Ion (Ionian),** from which all Greeks descended from
    - There is competing version of the story that states Hellen had a sister who then had a child with Zeus named **Magnos Makedos** (from which all Macedonians descended from), however during the 4th century parts of this version is forgotten and **Magnos Makedos is known as the fourth son of Hellen**
