# HIST223 - Week 2: Geography and Chronology

# Lecture Notes: Chronology
- **Chronology overview:**
	- Paleolithic: 500,000 - 8,300 BCE
	- Mesolithic: 8,300 - 6000 BCE
	- Neolithic: 7000 - 3200 BCE
	- Early Bronze Age: 3200 - 1900 BCE
	- Middle Bronze Age: 1960 - 1625 BCE
	- Late Bronze Age: 1625 - 1100 BCE
	- Early Iron Age/Geometric: 1100 - 800 BCE
	- Archaic Period: 800 - 480 BCE
	- Classical Period: 480 - 323 BCE
	- Hellenistic Period: 323 - 30 BCE

- Note that the early dates are more so approximations but the more recent ages become increasingly exact in their boundaries
- Later periods become defined based off of specific known datable historic events, gives clear points at which to distinguish them; no longer approximations

## Relative vs. Absolute Chronology
- Relative chronology = **qualitative** descriptors; uses a sequence of events/ages to develop a chronology (more vague)
- Absolute chronology = **quantitative** descriptors; uses exact numbers and dates (no vagueness)
	- Absolute chronologies may be more **precise** but they are not necessarily more **accurate**

- Ex: a chart of the list of Greek ages in a sequence are **relative chronology** while the exact dates to each age that accompanies the list is the **absolute chronology**

- Coming up with these dates often comes down to **archeology**

## Measuring Time
- **Units of time:**
	- Year = base unit
	- Decade = 10 year grouping
	- Century = 100 year grouping
	- Millennium

- Absolute dates require a **number** + **Era**

- **Era** = BCE/CE (Before Common Era/After Common Era), BC/AD (Before Christ/ Anno Domini), BP (Before Present)

- The numbers on either side of 1 BCE/CE **count up moving away from the middle**, meaning the dates do not count up in one direction in both eras

## Stratigraphy
> Stratigraphy ~ "The sequence of deposition of material"; Basically the order in which things become stuck in the ground

- What archaeologists find that is left behind of ancient structures, such as the **surviving brick foundation of a previously destroyed house**

- Generations of buildings being built and destroyed on the same land **slowly raises the ground** as each new builder builds on top of the rubble of before; this order of building generations can be studied
	- The mounds created by slowly raising the ground over generations are sometimes called **tells**; **"mounds that are created by successive layers of human occupations"**

## Dating Methods
- Different dating methods might disagree with each other however all align to labeled periods so often refering to the period by name rather than date is useful

### Stylistic Dating
- Chronological names are named according to styles of **pottery**
	- Pottery is used because it is the most common thing found at archaeological sites used to define periods

- **Seriation** = Archaeological process of establishing a sequence in which different kinds/styles of pottery were used at different times in order to determine to period they came from
	- Different styles are associated to different periods in which they were popular

### Radiocarbon Dating
- By measuring the levels of carbon-14 that are still present in a sample of **organic** material scientists can determine the age of the object since it has died

### Dendrochronology
- Tree ring dating
- Process of **matching similar tree ring samples** that overlap in their growth patterns (meaning they were from the same location at same time) to daisy chain samples going back thousands of years

# Lecture Notes: Geography

## Where is Greece?
- "Greece" means different things at different times; **historically changing borders**
- Territorial Expansion of Greece (1832-1947):

## Topography of Greece
- **Seas:**
	- **Aegean Sea** (East of Athens)
		- **Most important sea** around core of ancient Greek territory
	- Sea of Crete (Southeast of Athens)
	- Ionian Sea (West of Athens)
	- Libyan Sea (Further Southeast of Athens)

- Between the Aegean and the Ionian sea is the **Greek mainland**, of which the southern tip is called the **Peloponnese**
	- The southern part of the Greek mainland (Peloponnese) is connected to the northern part by a **small straight of land**

- The Landmass East of the Aegean is called **Asia Minor**

- South of the Aegean is the **Cyclades islands** (grouping of many small islands); further south past the Sea of Crete is the **island of Crete**;

## Larger Geography of Greece
- South of Greece is the **Mediterranean sea**, which is located between Europe, Asia, and Africa
- South of the Mediterranean is **Egypt** and **Libya**
- Northeast of Greece is the **Black Sea**, which is connected to the Aegean sea through channels
- East of Greece and the Aegean is **Asia Minor (Anatolia)**
- South of Asia Minor on the Mediterranean sea is the island of **Cyprus**

- To the West along the Mediterranean on the other side of the Ionian sea is **Italy** (and Sicily), which is sandwhiched on the East by the **Adriatic sea** and on the West by the **Tyrrhenian sea**

## Chronological Overview
- **Paleolithic**
	- Occupation on Greek mainland and some movement onto the islands
- **Mesolithic**
	- Much of the same as previous
- **Neolithic**
	- More of the same, in general some activity on mainland and a little spreading around the islands; neolithic revolution takes place
- **Early Bronze Age**
	- **3 regions develop:** **Cycladic region** (Cyclades islands), **Minoan region** (around Crete), and **Helladic region** (Greek Mainland)
	- Also a little activity in the **"Trojan-East Aegean" region** (Asia Minor) however this is not considered part of Greece at the time
- **Middle Bronze Age**
	- In the Middle Bronze Age, the **Minoan region** of Crete becomes the dominant culture
- **Late Bronze Age**
	- Reversal in the Late Bronze Age, as the **Helladic region** of the mainland becomes the dominant culture
	- The **Mycenaean culture** developed out of the **Peloponnese** and becomes the dominant culture
		- The Mycenaeans expanded the area of Greek contact during this age into **Egypt**, **the Levant**, and **Asia Minor**  
	- At the end of the Late Bronze Age, there is a period of reduced settlement multiplication due to mass migration; after several centuries of recovery **Greece begins to see lots of expansions**
- **Early Iron age/Geometric**
	- Period of mass expansion: From the **8th to 6th century** Greece grows to encapsulate all land around the **Aegean** and **Black sea**, as well as in southern Italy and Sicily, Parts of southern Spain and France, the Levant, and Egypt
	- General period of Greek growth in the **Aegean and eastern Mediterranean region**
- **Archaic Period**
	- More growth of Greece into the western Mediterranean
- **Classical Period**
	- Greece comes into conflict with its Western neighbor the **Persian Empire**, who expanded out of the Middle east
	- In the 5th Century many Greek **territories are lost** to the **Persian advances** 
	- Throughout the Classical period **Athens** remains the dominant power in the Greek world forming alliances with other states
	- Following Athen's rule over Greece, other states come to power at different times however ultimately it is **Macedon** in the north who rules the Greeks, leading them on a campaign to conquer the Persian empire.
- **Hellenistic Period**
	- In the Hellenistic period there is a refocusing of the Greek world from the Mediterranean/Aegean to the **Eastern part of the Mediterranean (Levant) and Asia**
	- Greece eventually breaks apart as it is conquered by the **Romans** starting in the **western Greek territories**

## Ecology of Greece
- Greece has good access to water, many rivers
- But very difficult terrain
	- Means that two places that might be close on the map are actually **fairly isolated from each other**
	- Means that two places might also be easier to reach by boat than by land; **geographically incentivised water travel**

## Climate of Greece
- Hot-summer Mediterranean climate; **Hot & dry**
	- Winters somewhat cooler
	- Central valley of California is a similar climate to Greece

- The Greeks expand their borders to places with **similar climates**
	- With a similar climate you can grow **similar crops**;
		- **"Mediterranean triad"** = olives, wheat, grapevines; very important crops for Greek society/livestyle

## Resources of Greece
- Limestone and **marble** is very abundant in the Greek landscape; explains its wide use

- **Seismic and volcanic activity** is common in Greece; will become important in the Bronze Age

- Lots of minerals available in the Greek world; **Gold, iron, copper, silver, lead**
	- What is missing in the Greek world is **tin** and must be gotten from far away; important because tin is used to mix with copper to mix with bronze
	- This means that **long distance trading routes** are required in order for Greece to enter the Bronze Age

# Lecture Notes: Paleolithic/Mesolithic [500,000-8000 BP]
- Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic = **"Stone Age"**
	- Pal = **old**, Meso = **middle**, Neo = **new**; lith = **"stone"** is Greece

## Greek Stone Age
- **Lower Paleolithic - 500,00 to 250,000 BCE**
	- Homo erectus establishes presence
- **Middle Paleolithic - 300,000 to 35,000 BCE**
	- Homo neanderthalensis establishes presence
	- Technology slowly developing
- **Upper Paleolithic - 45,000 to 12,000 BCE**
	- Homo sapiens establishes presence
	- Technology further developing
- **Epipaleolithic - 12,000 to 7,000 BCE**
	- Last ice age ends; **temperate and hot/warm summer** climates emerge in Greece
	- Warmer waters means that seafood can enter the diet
	- Farming begins in the near East (not in Greece yet)
	- Technology becomes smaller and more complex to perform more specialized tasks like fishing
- **Mesolithic - 8,700 to 7,000 BCE**
	- Fishing becomes a key focus; reflected in the tools created
	- More permanent settlements and built structures
	- Burials become common
	- More long distance and overseas interactions
- Pre-ceramic Neolithic - 7,000 to 6,500 BCE
- Early Neolithic - 6,500 to 5,800 BCE
- Middle Neolithic - 5,800 to 5,300 BCE
- Late Neolithic - 5,300 to  4,500 BCE
- Final Neolithic - 4,500 to 3,200 BCE

- Chronologies are slowly redefined over time leading to increasingly specific sub-periods emerging (Ex: pre-ceramic Neolithic)

- Ranges for periods sometimes **overlap** because the periods are defined by changes in **technological and social intelligence** and because there is some discrepancy in the times these changes occur the ranges are not immune to overlap

## Early Humans & Tool Industries
- Permanent occupation of early humans in Greece begins from 500,000 years ago in the Lower Paleolithic with **Homo erectus using Acheulean style tools**

- **Industry** = style of tool technology for the time

- **Homo habilis** uses **"Oldowan"** style tools (pebble tools); **no surviving record of Homo habilis in Greece**
- **Homo erectus** emerges in the **Lower Paleolithic** (500,000 years ago) and uses  **"Acheulean"** style tools (handaxes)
- **Homo neanderthalensis** emerges in the **Middle Paleolithic** (300,000 years ago) and uses **"Mousterian"** style tools (levallois flakes; tools made from **knapping**)
- **Homo sapiens** emerges in the **Upper Paleolithic** and uses **"Aurignacian"** style tools (blade/bone)

- Main activity for humans during the Stone Ages is **hunting & gathering**; food is required for survival and therefor cultivating it takes up all their time

- Early human occupation of Greece is found mainly in **caves** on the mainland, with little activity occurring on the islands meaning **some form of naval travel was possible during the Paleolithic**
	- Symbolic material culture (cave art) is not found in Greek caves, likely due to low population density making such forms of communication unnecessary 
- Evidence of occupation often comes in the form of **campsites**, where evidence can be found related to the activity occurring at these campsites i.e. living
	- This means that studying the stone tools that are found at these campsites is important to uncovering the lifestyle of early Greeks such as eating habits, levels of intelligence, etc.

### Sociopolitical Typology
- Bands (social organization of this period)
	- small groups of hunter-gatherers; groups must be kept small because of **limited food stores**
- Tribes
- Chiefdoms
- States
- [Advanced states]

## Key Mesolithic Sites 
- **Theopetra cave**
- **Cyclope cave**
- **Franchthi cave**
	- Fishing tools and tuna bones were recovered here
- **Island of Melos**
	- Home of **obsidian**; obsidian is important for tools and also because it leaves a chemical signature allowing us to find out where tools originally came from. Many obsidian tools recovered on the mainland were found to have originated from the island of Melos (meaning there must have been some contact)

# Lecture Notes: Neolithic [7000-3200 BCE]
- Neolithic = emergence of **farming** (wheat)

## Greek Stone Age
- Lower Paleolithic - 500,00 to 250,000 BCE
- Middle Paleolithic - 300,000 to 35,000 BCE
- Upper Paleolithic - 45,000 to 12,000 BCE
- Epipaleolithic - 12,000 to 7,000 BCE
- Mesolithic - 8,700 to 7,000 BCE
- **Pre-ceramic Neolithic - 7,000 to 6,500 BCE**
	- Transition from hunter-gatherer to sedentary societies
	- Neolithic revolution: Farming bring a surplus, leading to free time and the division of labor which also leads to Social differentiation; a lot of new developments in the Neolithic period
- **Early Neolithic - 6,500 to 5,800 BCE**
- **Middle Neolithic - 5,800 to 5,300 BCE**
- **Late Neolithic - 5,300 to  4,500 BCE**
- **Final Neolithic - 4,500 to 3,200 BCE**

- Neolithic begins in Greece slightly later than in the Middle East
	- People in the Middle East who are migrating to Greece bring their technology and knowledge with them; reason for why there is a delay in advancements reaching Greece
- Main crop of **wheat** which starts in the **fertile crescent** and spreads to the Mediterranean

- **In general the Neolithic period sees:** further sophistication of tools, increased trade contacts, emergence farming and agricultural revolution to support permanent settlements, food surplus creates valuable leisure time metal use, emergence of pottery and art, development of burial practices

## Neolithic Revolution
- **Agricultural revolution (and agricultural surpluses)**
	- People begin taking control of the food supply, first through the cultivation of wild plants, then through planting their own plants and achieving increasingly greater yields to create a **surplus**; creation of farms and stockpiles of food which can be saved and relied upon to eat without work **leading to free time and a rapid advancement of technology**
	- An **Agricultural surplus** (stockpile) is extremely important to developing humans because it allows them to stop spending all their time producing food and instead focus on other tasks like advancing as a society
	- Surplus of food also always leads to **increase in population**
- Domestication of animals
	- Important for the production of products other than food such as wool
- Permanent settlements
- **Leisure time**
	- Once leisure time is achieved through having a stockpile of food to rely on, technology and ideas start to develop much faster; **once humans have free time, they can spend it investing in themselves**
- Secondary products revolution
- Specialization of labor
	- Specialization leads to a more complex, advanced society
	- Specialization of labor -> **civilization**
- Pottery
- Social Hierarchy (stratification)
	- Diversification of labor leads to the inhearent emergence of a power structure to govern it and leads to social **classes** 

## Town of Sesko & Dimini
- **Town of Sesko** features a cluster of many small houses surrounding one **big house**, which walls radiate out from
	- It is unclear whether the big house is a communal space or the space of a leader
	- Walls may have been defensive however were quite low so may have also been to divide land ownership

- **Town of Dimini** is similar in layout structure to Sesko
	- Features walls that are also unclear if for defensive or demarcation
	- Layout is centered around one **large house**, however it does not hold any nicer objects so it may also be a communal space

- **Megaron** = the great hall of palace complexes
	- Usually divided into three parts: a porch, anti-chamber, inner-chamber
	- Megaron styles slowly develop until they resemble the standard Greek and roman palace architecture 

## Neolithic Structures
- Early Neolithic building = **wattle and daub hut**
	- Wattle refers to weaving sticks together to create frameworks (fences, walls, roofs)
	- Daub is a mud plaster to solidify everything creating walls

- In the Middle Neolithic things are slightly more complex, possibly having multiple rooms for different purposes however are still rudimentary permanent homes made from surrounding materials

## Pottery
- Starting in the Early Neolithic pottery emerges, being used for dining however later more for **storage**
- Pottery slowly becomes more advanced artistically and technologically (such as techniques to make pottery more heat resistant)

- Pottery survives time extremely well and is why it is the most common form of artifact

## Metal in Greece
- Jewelry was often made out of metals like **copper**
- Use of metal grows slowly over time and is dependent on long distance trade to obtain **tin** needed to start the **Bronze Age**

## Burials
- Inhumation/cremation:
	- **Inhumation** refers to the practice of putting the dead in the ground
	- **Cremation** refers to the practice of burning the dead and keeping the ashes

- Extramural/intramural:
	- **Extramural** refers to burying the dead beyond the settlement boundary (more common historically)
	- **Intramural** refers to burying/keeping the dead within the settlement boundary (in the form of ashes or disarticulated bones)

- Articulated/disarticulated:
	- **Articulated** refers to a normal connected skeleton
	- **Disarticulated** refers to deconstructed skeleton remains; "jumble of bones"

- Sometimes bodies might be buried **twice**, first for the bodies to decompose and then again for the bones to be relocated

- The construction of **tombs** for the dead started on the island of **Keos** at the site of **Kephala** and quickly the practice of housing the dead in tombs spread throughout the cycladic islands

## Art
- Where other parts of Europe experienced this development before, Greece now sees the creation of art happening in the Neolithic period
- Art in the form of **figurines**

# Reading Notes: Parker Ch. 1

# Reading Notes: Mee Ch. 1

# Reading Notes: Bintliff Ch. 2-3
- **Homo Erectus > Homo Neanderthalensis > Homo Sapiens**

- **Industry** = technological "style"
- **Acheulean** = an archaeological industry of stone tools characterized by oval/pear shaped "handaxes" associated with Homo Erectus and derived species
- **Levallois-Mousterian** = **technocomplex of stone tools**, associated primarily with the Neanderthals in Europe; style in which a flake "core" is sharpened through **knapping**; successor to previous industry of choppers and handaxes

## Chapter 2: Hunter-Gatherers (The Paleolithic and Epipalaeolithic in Greece)

### The Wider Framework
- Human being arose in Sub-Saharan Africa 5-8 million years ago
- By 2.7 mya had developed a stone tool tradition of **Oldowan** (chopper-flake) type

- **Sapiens** arose in Africa, and broke out into Eurasia around 100 kya (thousand years ago), to compete and finally displace all other human species
	- A new stone tool technology arose by 50 kya to replace the **Levallois-Mousterian** of the later Neanderthals

> "Nonetheless, the emergence of Neanderthal Man, and the changed scale of human spread over Europe, seem to be fundamentally related: the association emphasizes greater brain-size, increased socialization, and a more pronounced division of gender tasks between cooperating male large-game hunters, and female gatherers and small-game hunters.

- In Europe, Neanderthals were alone until the Sapiens arrived with **Upper Palaeolithic tools and more developed culture** from around 45 kya. Between then and 25 kya Modern Humans expanded through Europe and the **Neanderthals became extinct**
	- Evidence shows that during this period **significant interbreeding must have occurred**

- Interglacial = **"Holocene"**; time of humans

- Emergence of Modern Humans coincided with the **Glacial Era**; Humans were able to survive this era with their adaptive intelligence through the elaboration of new forms of resource exploitation and wider use of food (such as seafood)
	- During this period **new stone industries were developed in most places** called Epipalaeolithic or **Mesolithic** that were associated with these **new forms of complex food cultivation practices**

### The Hunter-Gatherers of Greece
- **Little is found in Greece from the timespan when hunter-gatherers lived in Europe** due to geological process which have destroyed or hidden the record of **hundreds of thousands of years of human presence in Greece**

- If Europe was first colonized by **Homo Erectus** 1-2 mya, with a likely entry point through the **Balkans**, then Greece would have likely seen human occupation.

- The oldest human activity appears to include **handaxes**; **"chopper-flake"/Acheulean** industry style

> Based on the European record, and its general agreement with the Greek material, Middle Palaeolithic hominids in Greece (Neanderthal M an), foraged in small groups, irregularly merging into larger social gatherings (up to about 150 individuals) at times of richest resource profusion. Rather than remaining in one location they ranged over a large annual territory, to coincide with the seasonal appearance of herds of animals or stocks of edible plants in particular are as of the regional landscape, as well as to visit geological outcrops to obtain raw material for tools

-  **Homo Neanderthalensis**, competed successfully in the Levant with expanding fully modern Homo sapiens from around 100 kya, and then unsuccessfully in Europe after 45 kya, but through interbreeding did contribute to the latter's genetic make-up
	- Greece's first human remains, like its oldest well-dated open air lithic sites, appear to be early Middle Palaeolithic, and come from the **Petralona Cave in Northern Greece**, probably ~300 kya; they may be Neanderthal Man

> It was these later Neanderthal populations in Europe who adopted new technologies which were diffusing through the Old World, significantly expanding stone toolkits beyond handaxes and chopper-flake tools, into more complex tool manufacturing and tool diversity. Around 300 kya, these new forms of stone-tool preparation appear, distinctive for the Middle Palaeolithic era and known collectively as the Levallois-Mousterian tradition

- Handaxes & chopper-flak tools **(Acheulean)** > sharpened cores made from knapping rocks **(Levallois-Mousterian)**; **less complex > more complex**

- Modern humans with Upper Palaeolithic culture probably colonized the Balkans from the Middle East and the Black Sea steppes around 45-30 kya. By 30 kya Neanderthals and the Mousterian have died out throughout Europe, so that Upper Palaeolithic modern humans and their novel toolkits are now the only people and culture through-out the subcontinent

- **Interbreeding between Modern Humans and Neanderthals** coincides with the worst climate in Europe, **the Ice Age Climax**, 20-30 kya, which caused human populations to gather in the far south for survival
	- Some argue that the close packing of refugee hunter-gatherer groups may have stimulated symbolic activity such as **cave art**
- After the cold, arid maximum around 18 kya, the final Glacial sees warmth returning to Greece, but more tardily increased moisture. Upper Palaeolithic activity becomes visible again, including the **expansion of hunting sites into the now more attractive high uplands**, still open and with milder climates
	- **A reorientation of hunter-gatherer annual ranges (seasonal movements) and economic strategies occurred**; The raw materials in use for tool- making atTheopetra Cave now shift from local stone, suiting a confined regional annual round, to significant amounts of long-distance imports. **This change could reflect expanding trade networks, or point to lowland foragers now themselves expanding their annual seasonal movements into the uplands**, as the lowlands gradually became wooded and less attractive to game herds throughout the year

- A key site for Upper Palaeolithic occupation, although never permanent through the year, is the **Franchthi Cave** in the Northeast Peloponnese
	- Here there was also Middle Palaeolithic occupation, and a  very significant occupation in the Early Holocene (Post-glacial) period, when human activity in Greece as a whole has proved difficult to identify

- **Franchthi Cave**
	- **Upper Palaeolithic** hunting groups utilizing Franchthi as temporary residence pursued deer and wild horse or ass; these groups leave little waste
	- The stone tool assemblage now diversifies along with far more rubbish build-up, indicating longer use and more varied activities at Franchthi. Wild cattle and goat join the game hunted, and collected seeds include wild vegetables and wild cereals. Furthermore, shellfish and fish are added to the diet as fishing becomes more widespread
	- Following this phase an exotic raw material is used for tool preparation: **obsidian** from the distant **island of Melos**
	- Around 10 kya Franchthi enters its **Mesolithic** phase

- The import of obsidian from the **Cycladic island of Melos** to Franchthi Cave proves that **adequate boat technology was available** in Mesolithic Greece

- The economy reflects a **"broad spectrum"** expansion from traditional Palaeolithic larger game, since fishing (including large species such as tuna), shell-fishing, and land mollusk collecting are central sources of nourishment, alongside birds
	- Under a **broad spectrum economy** a greater amount of **low-value prey** (i.e. high cost-to-benefit ratio) would be included because there are insufficient high-value prey to reliably satisfy a population's needs

- The mature Early Holocene environment saw rising sea-levels and far more running freshwater, marshes, lakes, and varied forms of woodland leading to a wider variety of flora and fauna for early humans to utilize
	- New abundances in more varied food sources supported a local network of regionally dense hunter-gatherers

### The Lifeworld of Hunter-Gatherers in Greece
> In the Klithi Cave Box we summarize how one major specialist in this phase of Greek archeology has offered us both a  realistic attempt to maximize our insights into economic and social life, and a personal philosophical viewpoint on what can and cannot be achieved in terms of the mentalities of Greece's remote hunter-gatherer world

- **The Klithi Cave**
	- Klithi is a cave in an upland valley of Epirus, Northwestern Greece. **Hunters used it** primarily in the Tardiglacial (final Glacial) era, 16,500-13,000 BP
	- Game caught was open rugged landscape fauna, **ibex and chamois**, comprising 99 percent of the animal bones. The main activity carried out from Klithi was killing these animals and converting their carcasses into food, artifacts, and clothing; **Plants were insignificant in the diet**
	- **Eric Higgs**, suggest that 5-10 people, less likely 10-20 people, used the cave together and were probably a family rather than a male hunting group
	- After the period of use of Klithi conditions became less favorable for different reasons: trees spread rapidly as the Glacial era faded and the animals hunted moved further up the mountains to find their open habitat. The Mesolithic hunters of the next stage may have focused more on wood-land game in the lowlands

- After the climax of the cold period during the **Late Glacial Period**, **sea levels rose dramatically** due to all the warming and caused human exploration of mountain regions. **Due to rising sea levels, an entire period of human settlement within Greek lowland is lost underwater (100-130 meters)**

## Chapter 3: Early Farming Communities (Neolithic Greece)
- **Chronology:**
	- **Primary phase of Greek Neolithic** or First Farmers, the so-called **Pre-ceramic**, begins 7000 BC
	- **Early Neolithic** (EN, ceramics in general use) begins 6500 BC
	- **Middle Neolithic** (MN) begins 5800 BC
	- **Early phase of Late Neolithic** (LN) begins 5300 BC
	- **Later LN** begins 4800 BC
	- **Final Neolithic** (FN) begins 4500 BC
	- **Early Bronze Age** (EBA) begins 3200 BC

- Recognized Archaeological Eras: **Palaeolithic and Mesolithic** (early and later hunter-gatherers), **Neolithic** (first farmer and herder societies), **Bronze Age** (mature farmer-herder societies with copper then bronze metallurgy), and **Early and Later Iron Age**

### Origins of the Greek Neolithic

### Settlement Patterns
- Topography, climate, and soils favored dense but isolated clusters of settlements in certain regions, with a much thinner cover else-where

### Settlement Form
- The known Neolithic settlements of Greece are dominated by the nucleated tell-village, with dispersed farms and hamlets of non-tell type clearly in a minority

- A **"tell"** = a mound consisting of the debris from generations of past settlements all being built on the same land so that it slowly elevates over time as the generations of debris grow

- **General characteristics of tells:**
	- These artificial mounds represent villages with pro-longed occupation and the dominance of mud brick architecture, where over centuries or even millennia new houses are built upon the remains of older and accumulated domestic debris, constantly elevating the village mound

- There is a cross-cultural tendency for human settlements without social classes to break up or undergo "fission" when they reach around 200-300 individuals
	- Beyond 150 people social bonding becomes difficult to sustain and encourages conflict. A common solution is for a part of the growing village to break off and **found a daughter settlement nearby**
