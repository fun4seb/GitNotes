- **Chronological Divisions of the Bronze Age in the Aegean:**
    - **3000–1900 BCE = Early Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Early Helladic
        - On Crete: Early Minoan
    - **1900-1600 BCE = Middle Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Middle Helladic
        - On Crete: Middle Minoan
        - (Linear A in use on Crete)
    - **1600-1200 BCE = Late Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Late Helladic or Mycenaean
        - On Crete: Late Minoan
        - (Linear B in use on Crete and in mainland Greece)

- The Late Bronze Age in mainland Greece is often subdivided as **Early Mycenaean, Middle Mycenaean, and Late Mycenaean**

## Prehistory
- The best-known prehistoric people in Greece were the **Minoans** who lived on **Crete** in the Early and Middle Bronze Age
    - Minoan people named after the mythological king of the island, **Minos**
- The Minoans created impressive palaces, art, and left records in two undeciphered scripts known as **Cretan Hieroglyphic** and **Linear A**
- The Minoans traded with **Egypt**, and a handful of Egyptian texts mention them under the name “Keftiu” 
- Greek legends speak of a Minoan **thalassocracy** (naval supremacy) in the Aegean; The power of the Minoan civilization was dependent on its navy

- The Greeks of the Bronze Age are conventionally known as **Mycenaeans** after the important archaeological site of **Mycene**
    - First excavated by **Heinrich Schliemann**, better known as the excavator of **Troy** in Asia Minor
- Mycene in Greek myth was the residence of the mythological king **Agamemnon** who in led the Greeks in a war against Troy in Homer's **Iliad**
- The Mycenaeans left behind documents in a script called **Linear B**, which is derived from the older Minoan **Linear A**
- Despite Mycenaean culture being similar to the older Minoans, they were distinguished in some ways, most prominently through the presence in Mycenaean palaces of a **megaron** (a central hall), which was a feature lacking in Minoan Ones

- **At some point before the 13th century**, the Mycenaeans from the mainland established a Mycenaean kingdom on Crete that included the central and western parts of the island. The Minoans who remained under Mycenaean rule slowly became **Hellenized** (to be assimilated into Greek culture)
- Some Minoans may still have held onto the eastern portion of Crete, and it is from the town of **Praesus** in the east that a few so-called **Eteocretan** inscriptions of classical date are known. These inscriptions are written in an undeciphered non-Greek language which might be the classical descendant of that written on the Linear A tablets in the Bronze Age

- **WILL BE READING QUIZ**

## The Downfall of the Mycenaean Kingdoms
- From the 13th to 12th centuries BC, there is a **pattern of destruction** seen throughout Mycenaean Greece that **caused the collapse of the Mycenaean Kingdoms**

- The cause of this destruction is argued and thus many theories exist, a common reasoning being that a **mass earthquake event** wiped out the Mycenaeans, or a portion of them causing too much strain on the surviving ones causing the collapse of them all
- Another common theory to explain the destruction is that there was a **Aegean-Anatolian drought** that caused the kingdoms to resort to war in order to procure food however Linear B record show no evidence of warfare, a drought, food shortage
- Another common theory suggests that internal instability within the kingdoms themselves led to their collapse however once again no Linear B records support this theory

### Sea Peoples
- If internally there is nothing to explain the collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, could there have been an **external threat?**
- According to Ramses III invaders from the north attacked various lands in the eastern Mediterranean, a claim which is corroborated by archaeological evidence at the sites
    - **His claim is proven because firstly, the sites he stated that were destroyed, were in fact destroyed, and secondly, the attack on the island of Cyprus implies that the marauders were sea-borne which is also confirmed**
    - The claim that the invaders were sea-borne is also corroborated by the fact that the Pylian kingdom in its final year assigned troops to watch the coastline suggesting they anticipated attack from the sea

- Ramses III goes on to name five invading peoples, three of whom can convincingly be identified:
    - the **Philistines** who eventually settled in the southwestern corner of Palestine (which the Greeks later named after them)
        - In Greek they are called **Palaistinoi** (which means the people who come from Palaiste, a town in Illyria to the northwest of Greece; an ethnicon like "NewYorker")
        - According to passages in the Old Testament the Philistines settled shortly on Crete which was the site of a Mycenaean kingdom destroyed mysteriously around the same time
    - the **Shikalaeans** who settled in the town of Dor just south of Mt. Carmel on the Palestinian Coast
    - and the **Dananaeans** who settled in Adana in what later became Cilicia

> So, in brief, around 1200 BC violent sea-borne raiders, some of whom came from Illyria, caused the destruction of many states and cities in the northeastern Mediterranean; and they also destroyed the Mycenaean kingdoms

## The Arrival of New Peoples after the Catastrophe
- The sea-borne invaders did not settle in Greece after destroying the Mycenaean kingdoms and instead kept moving choosing to settle in the eastern Mediterranean
- The survivors were left to rebuild after the collapse of the Mycenaeans to the Sea Peoples however archaeological evidence shows that **the number of settlements drops sharply from the 13th century to the 12th and 11th century**
    - The sharp reduction in the population of Greece at the time proves the Mycenaean kingdom's ability to maintain prosperity in Greece; without the kingdom to manage affairs decline sets in and this is seen in the material culture of the survivors as luxury goods that were common before the catastrophe become completely missing in the archaeological record immediately following the catastrophe

- The sharp decline in population, and absence of a governing power capable of defending Greece from outside invaders, allowed for new peoples to settle in Greece the most successful of which were called the **Dorians**
    - Entrance of the Dorians onto the Peloponnese and elsewhere = **the Dorian Invasion**; misleading as the process was peaceful

- The evidence pointing to the Dorian entry into the former territory of the Mycenaean kingdoms is **linguistic**, not archaeological; In the 13th century BC people used Mycenaean Greek on the Peloponnese and Crete,yet in those same places people were using **Doric Greek** instead a few centuries later 
    - Dorians and Mycenaeans both spoke a different dialect of Greek, the dialects are different in a way that means Dorian Greek could not possibly evolve into Mycenaean Greek, **meaning the Dorians must have immigrated onto Crete and the Peloponnese after the 13th century BC**

- Two of the most important Dorian cities on the Peloponnese were Corinth and Sparta
    - Both are new, post-Mycenaean foundations; and both were founded in the second half of the tenth century BC. This suggests that some Dorians, at least in the period 950–900 BC, were settling the areas in which they would thereafter live

## Migrations Eastward across the Aegean

## Conclusion

# Reading Notes: Parker Ch. 4 (Greece in the Later “Dark Age”)
- **Polis vs. Ethnos**
    - Polis = city-states
    - Ethnos = tribe-states
