# HIST223 - Week 8: Athenian Empire

# Lecture Notes: Herodotus & Ionian Revolt [499-494 BC]
- **Greeks vs. Persians**

## Herodotus
- First Greek author to attempt to give an overview of historical events at the time; **first historian**

- Historia = "inquiry"; Herodotus attempts to provide a "history" of conflicts so that they may not be forgotten, compiling them into a sequence of events as well as the **reason** these events happen

- Very dedicated to uncovering the truth behind the Persian conflict, rejecting mythological explanations, and compiling his findings into the book "The Histories" (no official title)
    - He is at times very credible and also sometimes too accepting of his sources; **the book has varying levels of validity throughout**

## The Persian Wars
- 499-494 BC: Ionian revolt
- 492 BC: Expedition of Mardonius
- 490 BC: First Persian War
    - 490 BC: Battle of Marathon
- 480-479 BC: Second Persian War
    - 480 BC: Battle of Thermopylae, Artemisium, Salamis
    - 479 BC: Battle of Plataea, Mycale

- Notable Persian kings relavent to the Persian Wars:
    - **Cyrus II**: grew the Persian empire to the vast scale it was
    - **Darius I**: First king to come into conflict with the Greeks, expands the limits of the Persian empire beyond what Cyrus accomplished
    - **Xerxes I**

- Herodotus is the **main source for the conflict between Greece and Persia** and traces the origin back to **king Croesus of Lydia**, who started a **period of Lydian expansion to control the western half of Asia Minor**, making the Ionian Greeks along the west coast of Lydia his tributary subjects
    - **Cyrus II** then conquers media, and later Lydia, bringing the Ionian Greeks under his control as well as all of the Persian empire

- The Persians, who now rule over the Ionian Greeks, demand submission of their subjects and tyrannically rule of the Greeks within their borders

- After Darius usurps power to rule Persia, he reorganizes the empire to solidify his rule; **tighter control over the Persian territories**
    - His main objective is to expand the Persian empire
    - He uses the vast movement of the Persian army, fueled by tributes from all over the empire, to make his Persian might known both to neighbors and states all across the empire

- Under Darius, Persia expands westward towards **Asia Minor and into Thrace** and once it reaches the ocean it becomes a **naval power**; **under Darius' expansion Persia gains control over some parts of the Greek territories**

### Ionian Revolt
- Fueled by many things however notably the growing discontent with the **tyranny of Persia** ruling over Ionia

- Darius installs a tyrant called **Aristagoras** to rule over **Miletos**, however as he suspects revolt against tyranny is inevitable in Ionia, he institutes a more democratic system and **leads a revolt himself against the other tyrants in the region**
    - Aristagoras creates a **coalition** of Miletus, Athens, and Eretria to oppose the imminent Persian force and destroy the Persian capital of **Sardis** (which they accomplish successfully)

- After Sardis is burned down by the coalition, the Persian forces arrive and the Greeks retreat to **Ephesus** where they are defeated and the Athenians return back to Athens

- The revolt starting at **Miletus** serves as the catalyst for the other Greek cities along the west coast of Asia Minor, Cyprus, and Byzantium to revolt against its Persian occupiers

- Despite the mass revolts the Persians eventually overpower the Greek cities and lead a campaign to stamp out each place of revolt

- In 494 BC, The decisive battle is fought at **Lade** where a large Persian naval force is confronted by a larger Greek coalition
    - Persia responds to this larger force by buying off parts of the coalition until the force is more manageable and proceeds to defeat them
    - After the Persian victory at Lade, Persia sieges **Miletus** where the revolts all started and successfully destroys the city

- After the revolt, Persia consolidates its power in Asia Minor and Thrace however changes their ruling style to be somewhat more democratic to deter further discontentment among its subjects

# Reading Notes: Parker Chap. 11 (The Athenian Empire)
- **Chronology**
    - 479 BC: Battle of Cape Mycale
    - Winter of 479-478 BC: Athenians take Sestos
    - 478-477 BC: Delian League formed
    - 466 (?) Battle of the Eurymedon
    - 466–465 (?) Siege of Naxos
    - 465–463 (?) Siege of Thasos

## The Creation of the Delian League
- Despite the victory over Persia at Salamis and Plataea that decided the eventual outcome of the Persian wars, there were a few problems...
    1. The Persians still continued to hold strategic territory in Europe such as **Byzantium**
    2. Many Greeks were still under Persian rule in **Asia Minor** and **Cyprus**

- In 479 BC, the Greek fleet under the command of the Lacedaemonian king **Laotychidas II** surprised the Persian fleet in east Aegean waters, off Cape Mycale; The Persians refused a naval fight and the Greeks responded by **disembarking his infantry to defeat the land forces at Cape Mycale**
    - Greek triremes carried infantry about called the **epibatai** (infantry force made up of fourteen hoplites and four archers)

- Against the backdrop of the Ionian revolt against the Persians in Asia Minor by the Greeks 15 years prior, and now that the Greeks were on the offensive in Asia Minor, Greeks in the area took the chance to revolt once again 

- With campaigning season ending Laotychidas II decided to return back to Sparta, however the Athenian forces and their triremes wanting to continue the fight to liberate all Greeks from Persian rule
    - With the Athenians now on their own to liberate the Greeks, their besieged the town of **Sestos**

- When the Lacedaemonians returned with a new commander, **Pausanias**, they **decided against the further invasion of Asia Minor** and instead chose to fight the Persians on **Cyprus** (the plan was to resettle the Greeks of Asia Minor in the Greek territories which had previously fought on the Persian side, specifically **Thessaly** and **Boeotia**)
    - Despite a successful campaign in Cyprus and the later capture of Byzantium, **Pausanias was growing increasingly unpopular** and resulted in him being recalled back to Sparta

- The termination of Pausanias resulted in the **Athenians taking over leadership of the anti-Persia alliance**; this leadership was something they sought after as the Ionians placed themselves under the Athenians protection after their liberation

- This resulted in the anti-Persian league being reorganized according to Athenian views
    1. Athens provided the military commanders
    2. For the first time **dedicated arrangements for the financing of campaigns in the form of a treasury** (something that Sparta did on an "ad hoc" basis)

- The treasury was located on the Cycladic island of **Delos**, where meetings of the member states took place as well, and were managed by treasurers called the **Hellenotamiai** ("Greek Treasurers")
    - Despite the claim to be a "Greek alliance", the Lacedaemonians and their supporters (the Peloponnesians) were absent from the alliance, meaning the members were **largely Ionians and comprised of Athens, the Aegean islands, and Asia Minor**
    - The location of Delos, a place of **Ionian significance** (sanctuaries, etc.), resulted in the alliance being given its conventional name of the **Delian League**

- Members of the League could choose to contribute in the form of an annual payment of 460 talents or by sending forces to aid Athenians
    - This resulted in many members neglecting military participation and instead opting to support the League fiscally, something Athens did not object to as this kept them the only battle-hardened force in the League capable of bullying other members if they chose to not contribute

- While the Lacedaemonians did not meekly accept this and sent out a successor to Pausanias called **Dorcis** who the other Greeks refused to follow
    - King Laotychidas II also led out an expedition to Thessaly in an attempt to expel them and prepare for the Ionian resettlement in Thessaly however he failed and was allegedly bribed

- Following 477 all this activity ceases as the Lacedaemonians were elbowed aside by the Athenians

## Development of the Delian League into the Athenian Empire
- Now with the Lacedaemonians out of the way, the Athenians, at the head of the Delian League, were free to continue the war against Persia

- **Thucydides selects four events from the first twelve years of the league's history to show how the League developed under Athenian leadership:**
    1. First, the league expels the Persians from **Eion**, consistent with the League's sole purpose to wage war against Persians
    2. Second, the League captured the island of **Scyros** in the northern Sporades, despite there being no Persians on the island it was a **notorious pirate's nest** and they did the entire Aegean a favor
    3. Third, the League attacked the Euboean town of **Carystus**, a Greek town which had not joined the League and had previously fought for the Persians at Salamis; **This time, despite their sole purpose, league was fighting neither Persians nor a common threat**
    4. Fourth, the League lead a campaign against **Naxos**, a previous member who tried to leave the League by refusing to pay the annual fee (because there was no longer an enemy to fight). This was the first time the League led a campaign against a member state and set the precedent that the League was not comprised of free states but states under the **rule of Athens**
        - Athens defeated Persia in a "double battle" under the command of **Cimon**, effectively bringing hostility between Persia to an end and members such as Naxos refused to pay the League if no enemy was a threat

- With hostility between the Delian League and Persia at an end, many members (like Naxos) wondered why they were forced to make contributions to the Athenian-managed campaign treasury if there was no enemy to fight, however Athens demanded payments in order to protect members from any "future threats"; **the League had become a protection racket**
    - The Delian League, originally an alliance of independent states united to fight the Persians, **had been transmogrified into the Athenian Empire, a collection of subject states united for the greater glory of Athens**

- Around this time Athens probably concluded a formal peace with Persia, the **Peace of Callias** (named after the **negotiator Callias**, the brother-in-law of Cimon)

- Thucydides, despite being the most prominent source on the early years of the Delian League, was not the only source and surviving accounts exist from Diodorus/Ephorus. Comparisons between the sources show that both were actually based on the same source, **Hellanicus** (late-fifth-century BC writer on Athenian history)
    - While Diodorus' account is more erratic, it is possible more accurate as Thucydides occasionally skewed facts for his own narrative (such as the fact that he states members were responsible for their ejection from the League, something Diodorus never mentions as it was likely the result of Athenian greed/consolidation of power)

## Administration of the Athenian Empire
- Due to the way the empire merged, it was rather heterogeneous with "haphazard administration"
    - Some states retained considerable independence as they maintained fleets, kept fortification, and would prove to be difficult to defeat if they revolted such as Thasos or **Samos**

- Athens imposed tighter control on individual states on a case-by-base basis rather than by a unified rule (likely according to how much of a threat to the empire the individual state was)
    - In some states there were garrisons, in some there were Athenian governors called **episkopoi** ("inspectors")

- Athens tended to impose/restore **democratic constitutions**

- Some states (Ex: Naxos) suffered the most fear penalty, the confiscation of land and settlement of Athenians in a process called **cleruchy**

- Despite the heterogeneity and variance in administration among member states, some things did remain constant across the league
    1. Nearly every state paid the tribute, and the Athenians had the authority to regulate the payment, with Tribute paying members being organized into five districts/categories: **Carian, Ionian, Hellespontine, Thracian, and Island**
        - Regular tribute lists recorded what each town was to pay annually, down to the obol (half of one man’s daily wage)
    2. The Athenians banned both the goods and people of **Megara** from entering the empire
    3. The Athenians attempted to regulate currency across the empire, if they were successful the entire empire would have had a unified currency

## The Benefits of Empire
- With Athens acting as the empire’s chief port and marketplace, people could buy anything they wanted there due to the vast reach of the empire

- Athens used its income of 460 talents per member to construct impressive public works such as the Parthenon and the Propylaea (entrance to the acropolis); **the state-run, mob-like, protection racket funded the monuments of Athens and allowed it to become a very wealthy and powerful city**
    - The construction of these public works also attracted sculptors and artisans who could be rewarded for their masterful work

- **Athens becomes a cultural hub for Greece** as philosophers and scholars flock to Athens such as the sophists and **Herodotus**; due to the wealthy of Athens the people wanted the highest quality knowledge from around the world and were willing to pay for it

- **Tragic drama**, being fueled by the cultural and economic surge of Athens, became very popular and the tragedians Aeschylus, **Sophocles**, and Euripides created many plays to be performed at festivals on the southern slope of the Acropolis

> In this time of prosperity and cultural achievement Athens had confidence in
itself and its citizens, and it answered to no one but justice and its own laws.
