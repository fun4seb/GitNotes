## Pausanias and Themistocles
- Relations betweens Athens and Sparta were strained due to the way Athens usurped leadership of the anti-Persian alliance, however an ugly affair between **Pausanias and Themistocles** helped to ease these tensions

- Pausanias was accused of **"Medizing"** (betraying the Greeks to the Persians, who were called "Medes"), however he was acquitted and **left Sparta** to gain a following in the Hellespontine and later **captured and held Byzantium for 7 years**
    - After being expelled by the Athenians under Cimon he went to Colonae in the Troad, however after rumors of his medizing persisted he was re-summoned to Sparta for a second trial; as his fate became clear he took refuge in the sanctuary of Athena Chalcioecus where he was walled up by the ephors and left to starve
    - The "evidence" that condemned Pausanias were **(forged) letters** the ephors has gathered during their investigation and these letters **allegedly also implicated Themistocles who was living in Argos**

- Themistocles was forced out of his political position in Athens after the victory at Salamis due to **ostracism**, leading him to reside in **Argos**
    - The Athenian constitution allowed for an annual vote to banish **(ostracize)** any Athenian from Athens for ten years; this was originally meant as an anti-tyrannical policy however in reality it gave the dominant faction the means to end the careers of its political opponents through forced ostracism
    - Spartan authorities traveled to Athens with the "evidence" (forged letters) and Athens agreed to **cooperate in the arrest of Themistocles**
    - Themistocles then fled Argos and met with King Artaxerxes I of Persia (the son of the man whom he had helped defeat at Salamis) who awarded him with three cities in Asia Minor: Lampsacus, Magnesia on the Meander, and Myus 

- The end result of these allegations against Pausanias and Themistocles was the **renewed cooperation between Sparta and Athens to bring about their arrest**, which helped to mend relations after the bitterness of the events during the end of the Persian Wars

## The Helots' Revolt
- Shortly after the revolt of Naxos in circa 465, **Thasos revolted as well**
    - Despite Athens defeating the Thasian's fleet, the Thasians were prepared for a lengthy siege
    - Thucydides allegedly claims that the Lacedaemonians had made a **“secret” promise to the Thasians that they would invade Attica** in support of the revolt, however they were unable to fulfill this promise due to an **earthquake that struck Laconia**
    - This earthquake ripped several peaks from Mt. Taÿgetos and left only five houses in Sparta standing, and more importantly provided the opportunity for a **large-scale rising of the Helots**

- A revolt of the Helots was the Spartans worst nightmare, and due to the chaos that was provided by the earthquake it was now a reality

- While the Lacedaemonians quickly regained control of the countryside, the Helots retreated the **Mt. Ithome** where they used the natural strategic defenses of the mountain to prepare for siege
    - The natural fortress of Mt. Ithome made it untakeable by the Spartans who were inexperienced at siege warfare, causing them to **appeal to Athens for help who were renowned for their sieging ability**

- The current leader who succeeded Themistocles was **Cimon (leader of the Philaid clan)** who persuaded the rest of Athens to send an expedition to siege Mt. Ithome (he sympathized with Sparta despite the general attitude of distaste among Athenians)
    - **The Athenian siege force was customarily being provided for by Spartan provisions** however after it was clear the Athenians were having equal trouble sieging the Helots the Athenians were **dismissed**
    - This dismissal was taken as an enormous disrespect as Cimon had staked his reputation on this expedition and the people he attempted to aid humiliated him through the dismissal; **the result was Cimon losing his strong political reputation and prestige**

- The loss of Cimon's reputation led to a **constitutional change in Athenian democracy**
    - Following Cimon's humiliation at Mt. Ithome, his political opponents, notably **Ephialtes**, persuaded the Athenian Assembly to strip the **The Council of the Areopagus** (which consisted of all former archons and was allied to Cimon) of all its political powers
    - When Cimon attempted to undo these reforms and restore the power of the council he was quickly silenced with an **ostracism**

## Athens’ Imperial Ambitions in Greece and Abroad
- As the Helots' revolt dragged on Sparta was effectively immobilized as no army could leave Laconia with an ongoing revolt in their home territory
- This meant that as long as Sparta was occupied, the Athenians were free to develop their empire without interference; **Athen's ambition for growth grew considerably during this period**
    - **Megara** was involved in a boarder dispute with Corinth and after not receiving any help from the Spartans, turned to Athens and entered the Athenian Empire
    - In 460, the Athenians **liberated Cyprus** after it was recaptured by the Persians (nullifying the Peace of Callias), and after hearing that **Egypt revolted from Persia** later sailed there to aid the revolt; **Athens had added Cyprus and Egypt to it's empire**
    - In 457, war broke out between Athens and Aegina. Corinth, who thought the Athenians were fighting on too many fronts to respond to an attack on **Megara**, attacked them in an effort to settle the border dispute. Athens responded by sending the "oldest and the youngest" who decisively defeated the Corinthians

- Towards the end of the year 457 the **Phocians** invaded the Doris region which had ancestral significance to all Dorians (including Spartans). This shocked the Spartans into working to end their revolt by **negotiating with the Helots** (previously unthinkable)
    - They utilized an **oracle** as a face-saving device who spoke of "releasing the suppliant of Ithomaean Zeus", meaning the Spartans consented to letting the Helots who were holed up on Mt. Ithome leave if they agreed to never come back

- Freed from the siege, the Spartans army ferried to Phocis and the Phocians, who were not expecting the response of the Spartans, quickly conceded
    - **The Athenians responded**, though still heavily committed in the eastern Mediterranean and on Aegina, and met the Spartan army at **Tanagra (a town in Boeotia)**
    - The ensuring battle between the Spartans and Athenians resulted in a **draw**, and **after the battle the Spartans were only concerned with returning to the Peloponnese quickly** (something the Athenians did not attempt to prevent as they did not want another battle)
    - **Cimon**, who encouraged the Athenians during the battle, **was recalled from his ostracism early**

- As the Spartans worked to return to the Peloponnese, **Tolmides** (leader of the Athenian fleet who circumnavigated the Peloponnese) **picked up the Helots as they were leaving Mt. Ithome**, and in the absence of the Spartans the Athenians conquered Boeotia and additionally gained control of Phocis and Eastern Locris
    - The Athenians then **took 100 of the wealthiest Eastern Locrians as hostage** and demanded the strategic port of **Naupactus** on the bottleneck of the Gulf of Corinth from the Western Locrians and **resettled the Helots that Tolmides picked up there**; The Athenians now held a strategic point on the Gulf of Corinth which was settled with people who held an absolute hatred of the Spartans

- While the Athenians were now at the height of their powers it would not last for long as in 456 **the Persians reconquered and defeated the Athenians in Egypt** and Athenian expansion for the most part **ground to a halt**

- In 451 the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians **negotiated a peace for five years** allowing Athenians to once again sail to Cyprus to liberate it from Persia (something the Cyprians fought against as "liberation" may have seemed more like conquest to them)
    - Cimon, who commanded this expedition to Cyprus, died during the campaign however his fleet still managed to defeat the Persians in a sea battle, thereafter the fleet returned home with the **Peace of Callias renewed**

## The Revolts of 446 and the Thirty Years’ Peace
- After the five years' peace expired in 446 between Sparta and Athens, **a revolt sprung up in Boeotia** and the Boeotian rebels surprised the Athenians near **Coroneia** resulting in Athenian defeat and the Boeotians taking a number of Athenian prisoners
    - In an effort to retrieve the prisoners, Athens recognized Boeotian independence (they also lost control of Phocis and Eastern Locris during this time)

- **Megara and Euboea revolted as well**, and in the absence of a peace treaty a large Lacedaemonian army under **King Pleistoanax** invaded Attica in support of the revolts
    - **Pericles**, who held a prominent place in Athenian politics, negotiated with King Pleistoanax that if the Spartans withdrew from Attica, Athens would not challenge **Megara’s withdrawal from the Athenian Empire**
    - In exchange the Athenians were to receive a free hand on Euboea; Pericles effectively suppressed the Euboean revolt and established a cleruchy in Histiaea

- At this point Athen's land empire had disappeared and Pericles had restricted Athens to a **sea-borne empire**; Pericles then negotiated a **formal peace treaty with the Lacedaemonians to last for 30 years**
    - Pericles viewed it as impracticable for the Athenians to hold a land empire long term and by committing to a peace treaty of 30 years (during which Athens could not retake their lost land) **he forced Athens to spend the next 30 years consolidating itself into a more practicable and lucrative sea-bone empire**

- **The clauses of Pericles' treaty:**
    1. The treaty contained a list of allies of both Sparta and Athens
    2. Both Sparta and Athens were able to make alliances with neutral states
    3. Athens (and probably Sparta also) undertook to guarantee its allies’ “autonomy”
    4. The treaty contained a clause which, on one interpretation, allowed members of one alliance to travel freely into the other
    5. In the case of a dispute the treaty enjoined arbitration upon Sparta and Athens (though it remains murky what sort of arbitration)

## Athenian Democracy
- After the reformed instigated by Ephialtes took place, another constitutional reform took place, its instigator this time was not Ephialtes but his younger associate **Pericles**

- **Pericles’ reform:** pay for jury duty (2 obols per day)
    - With this he introduced the concept of **pay for public office** (salary for politicians), and it was quickly expanded; As soon as people began receiving a daily wage for holding an office, everyone could serve, because now no one suffered financially for being away from work
