# HIST223 - Midterm Notes
- **History vs. prehistory**
    - History = time of writing
    - Prehistory = time before writing

- **Relative vs. absolute chronology**
    - Relative chronology = **qualitative** descriptors; uses a sequence of events/ages to develop a chronology (more vague)
    - Absolute chronology = **quantitative** descriptors; uses exact numbers and dates (no vagueness)
        - Absolute chronologies may be more **precise** but they are not necessarily more **accurate**

- **Stratigraphy**
    - "The sequence of deposition of material"; Examining the order in which things become stuck in the ground to determine divisions in chronological periods

- **Stylistic dating**
    - Chronological periods are named according to styles of **pottery**; Pottery is used because it is the most common thing found at archaeological sites used to define periods

- **Seriation**
    - Archaeological process of establishing a sequence in which different kinds/styles of pottery were used at different times in order to determine to period they came from

- **Radiocarbon dating**
    - By measuring the levels of carbon-14 that are still present in a sample of **organic** material scientists can determine the age of the object since it has died

- **Dendrochronology**
    - Tree ring dating; process of **matching similar tree ring samples** that overlap in their growth patterns (meaning they were from the same location at same time) to daisy chain samples going back thousands of years

- **Bronze Age Chronology**
    - **3000â€“1900 BCE = Early Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Early Helladic
        - On Crete: Early Minoan
    - **1900-1600 BCE = Middle Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Middle Helladic
        - On Crete: Middle Minoan
        - (Linear A in use on Crete)
    - **1600-1200 BCE = Late Bronze Age**
        - In mainland Greece: Late Helladic or Mycenaean
        - On Crete: Late Minoan
        - (Linear B in use on Crete and in mainland Greece)
        - The Late Bronze Age in mainland Greece is often subdivided as **Early Mycenaean, Middle Mycenaean, and Late Mycenaean**

- **Minoan/Helladic/Cycladic**
    - Minoan = Crete
    - Helladic = mainland Greece (Peloponnese)
    - Cycladic = Aegean Islands (cluster of islands North of Crete)

- **Traditional vs. high chronology**
    - High chronology = dates compiled using historical records and artifacts; more commonly used by historians
    - Low chronology = dates compiled using more precise radio-carbon dating
