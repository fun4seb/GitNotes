- **Homo Erectus > Homo Neanderthalensis > Homo Sapiens**

- **Industry** = technological "style"
- **Acheulean** = an archaeological industry of stone tools characterized by oval/pear shaped "handaxes" associated with Homo Erectus and derived species
- **Levallois-Mousterian** = **technocomplex of stone tools**, associated primarily with the Neanderthals in Europe; style in which a flake "core" is sharpened through **knapping**; successor to previous industry of choppers and handaxes

## Chapter 2: Hunter-Gatherers (The Paleolithic and Epipalaeolithic in Greece)

### The Wider Framework
- Human being arose in Sub-Saharan Africa 5-8 million years ago
- By 2.7 mya had developed a stone tool tradition of **Oldowan** (chopper-flake) type

- **Sapiens** arose in Africa, and broke out into Eurasia around 100 kya (thousand years ago), to compete and finally displace all other human species
	- A new stone tool technology arose by 50 kya to replace the **Levallois-Mousterian** of the later Neanderthals

> "Nonetheless, the emergence of Neanderthal Man, and the changed scale of human spread over Europe, seem to be fundamentally related: the association emphasizes greater brain-size, increased socialization, and a more pronounced division of gender tasks between cooperating male large-game hunters, and female gatherers and small-game hunters.

- In Europe, Neanderthals were alone until the Sapiens arrived with **Upper Palaeolithic tools and more developed culture** from around 45 kya. Between then and 25 kya Modern Humans expanded through Europe and the **Neanderthals became extinct**
	- Evidence shows that during this period **significant interbreeding must have occurred**

- Interglacial = **"Holocene"**; time of humans

- Emergence of Modern Humans coincided with the **Glacial Era**; Humans were able to survive this era with their adaptive intelligence through the elaboration of new forms of resource exploitation and wider use of food (such as seafood)
	- During this period **new stone industries were developed in most places** called Epipalaeolithic or **Mesolithic** that were associated with these **new forms of complex food cultivation practices**

### The Hunter-Gatherers of Greece
- **Little is found in Greece from the timespan when hunter-gatherers lived in Europe** due to geological process which have destroyed or hidden the record of **hundreds of thousands of years of human presence in Greece**

- If Europe was first colonized by **Homo Erectus** 1-2 mya, with a likely entry point through the **Balkans**, then Greece would have likely seen human occupation.

- The oldest human activity appears to include **handaxes**; **"chopper-flake"/Acheulean** industry style

> Based on the European record, and its general agreement with the Greek material, Middle Palaeolithic hominids in Greece (Neanderthal M an), foraged in small groups, irregularly merging into larger social gatherings (up to about 150 individuals) at times of richest resource profusion. Rather than remaining in one location they ranged over a large annual territory, to coincide with the seasonal appearance of herds of animals or stocks of edible plants in particular are as of the regional landscape, as well as to visit geological outcrops to obtain raw material for tools

-  **Homo Neanderthalensis**, competed successfully in the Levant with expanding fully modern Homo sapiens from around 100 kya, and then unsuccessfully in Europe after 45 kya, but through interbreeding did contribute to the latter's genetic make-up
	- Greece's first human remains, like its oldest well-dated open air lithic sites, appear to be early Middle Palaeolithic, and come from the **Petralona Cave in Northern Greece**, probably ~300 kya; they may be Neanderthal Man

> It was these later Neanderthal populations in Europe who adopted new technologies which were diffusing through the Old World, significantly expanding stone toolkits beyond handaxes and chopper-flake tools, into more complex tool manufacturing and tool diversity. Around 300 kya, these new forms of stone-tool preparation appear, distinctive for the Middle Palaeolithic era and known collectively as the Levallois-Mousterian tradition

- Handaxes & chopper-flak tools **(Acheulean)** > sharpened cores made from knapping rocks **(Levallois-Mousterian)**; **less complex > more complex**

- Modern humans with Upper Palaeolithic culture probably colonized the Balkans from the Middle East and the Black Sea steppes around 45-30 kya. By 30 kya Neanderthals and the Mousterian have died out throughout Europe, so that Upper Palaeolithic modern humans and their novel toolkits are now the only people and culture through-out the subcontinent

- **Interbreeding between Modern Humans and Neanderthals** coincides with the worst climate in Europe, **the Ice Age Climax**, 20-30 kya, which caused human populations to gather in the far south for survival
	- Some argue that the close packing of refugee hunter-gatherer groups may have stimulated symbolic activity such as **cave art**
- After the cold, arid maximum around 18 kya, the final Glacial sees warmth returning to Greece, but more tardily increased moisture. Upper Palaeolithic activity becomes visible again, including the **expansion of hunting sites into the now more attractive high uplands**, still open and with milder climates
	- **A reorientation of hunter-gatherer annual ranges (seasonal movements) and economic strategies occurred**; The raw materials in use for tool- making atTheopetra Cave now shift from local stone, suiting a confined regional annual round, to significant amounts of long-distance imports. **This change could reflect expanding trade networks, or point to lowland foragers now themselves expanding their annual seasonal movements into the uplands**, as the lowlands gradually became wooded and less attractive to game herds throughout the year

- A key site for Upper Palaeolithic occupation, although never permanent through the year, is the **Franchthi Cave** in the Northeast Peloponnese
	- Here there was also Middle Palaeolithic occupation, and a  very significant occupation in the Early Holocene (Postglacial) period, when human activity in Greece as a whole has proved difficult to identify

- **Franchthi Cave**
	- **Upper Palaeolithic** hunting groups utilizing Franchthi as temporary residence pursued deer and wild horse or ass; these groups leave little waste
	- The stone tool assemblage now diversifies along with far more rubbish build-up, indicating longer use and more varied activities at Franchthi. Wild cattle and goat join the game hunted, and collected seeds include wild vegetables and wild cereals. Furthermore, shellfish and fish are added to the diet as fishing becomes more widespread
	- Following this phase an exotic raw material is used for tool preparation: **obsidian** from the distant **island of Melos**
	- Around 10 kya Franchthi enters its **Mesolithic** phase

- The import of obsidian from the **Cycladic island of Melos** to Franchthi Cave proves that **adequate boat technology was available** in Mesolithic Greece

- The economy reflects a **"broad spectrum"** expansion from traditional Palaeolithic larger game, since fishing (including large species such as tuna), shell-fishing, and land mollusk collecting are central sources of nourishment, alongside birds
	- Under a **broad spectrum economy** a greater amount of **low-value prey** (i.e. high cost-to-benefit ratio) would be included because there are insufficient high-value prey to reliably satisfy a population's needs

- The mature Early Holocene environment saw rising sea-levels and far more running freshwater, marshes, lakes, and varied forms of woodland leading to a wider variety of flora and fauna for early humans to utilize
	- New abundances in more varied food sources supported a local network of regionally dense hunter-gatherers

### The Lifeworld of Hunter-Gatherers in Greece
> In the Klithi Cave Box we summarize how one major specialist in this phase of Greek archeology has offered us both a  realistic attempt to maximize our insights into economic and social life, and a personal philosophical viewpoint on what can and cannot be achieved in terms of the mentalities of Greece's remote hunter-gatherer world

- The Klithi Cave
	- Klithi is a cave in an upland valley of Epirus, Northwestern Greece. **Hunters used it** primarily in the Tardiglacial (final Glacial) era, 16,500-13,000 BP
	- Game caught was open rugged landscape fauna, **ibex and chamois**, comprising 99 percent of the animal bones. The main activity carried out from Klithi was killing these animals and converting their carcasses into food, artifacts, and clothing; **Plants were insignificant in the diet**
	- **Eric Higgs**, suggest that 5-10 people, less likely 10-20 people, used the cave together and were probably a family rather than a male hunting group
	- After the period of use of Klithi conditions became less favorable for different reasons: trees spread rapidly as the Glacial era faded and the animals hunted moved further up the mountains to find their open habitat. The Mesolithic hunters of the next stage may have focused more on wood-land game in the lowlands

- After the climax of the cold period during the **Late Glacial Period**, **sea levels rose dramatically** due to all the warming and caused human exploration of mountain regions. **Due to rising sea levels, an entire period of human settlement within Greek lowland is lost underwater (100-130 meters)**

## Chapter 3: Early Farming Communities (Neolithic Greece)
- **Chronology:**
	- **Primary phase of Greek Neolithic** or First Farmers, the so-called **Pre-ceramic**, begins 7000 BC
	- **Early Neolithic** (EN, ceramics in general use) begins 6500 BC
	- **Middle Neolithic** (MN) begins 5800 BC
	- **Early phase of Late Neolithic** (LN) begins 5300 BC
	- **Later LN** begins 4800 BC
	- **Final Neolithic** (FN) begins 4500 BC
	- **Early Bronze Age** (EBA) begins 3200 BC

- Recognized Archaeological Eras: **Palaeolithic and Mesolithic** (early and later hunter-gatherers), **Neolithic** (first farmer and herder societies), **Bronze Age** (mature farmer-herder societies with copper then bronze metallurgy), and **Early and Later Iron Age**

### Origins of the Greek Neolithic

### Settlement Patterns
- Topography, climate, and soils favored dense but isolated clusters of settlements in certain regions, with a much thinner cover else-where

### Settlement Form
- The known Neolithic settlements of Greece are dominated by the nucleated tell-village, with dis-persed farms and hamlets of non-tell type clearly in a minority

- A **"tell"** = a mound consisting of the debris from generations of past settlements all being built on the same land so that it slowly elevates over time as the generations of debris grow

- **General characteristics of tells:**
	- These artificial mounds represent villages with pro-longed occupation and the dominance of mud brick architecture, where over centuries or even millennia new houses are built upon the remains of older and accumulated domestic debris, constantly elevating the village mound

- There is a cross-cultural tendency for human settlements without social classes to break up or undergo "fission" when they reach around 200-300 individuals
	- Beyond 150 people social bonding becomes difficult to sustain and encourages conflict. A common solution is for a part of the growing village to break off and **found a daughter settlement nearby**
