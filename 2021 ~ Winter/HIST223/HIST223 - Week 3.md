# HIST223 - Week 3: Early Bronze Age

# Lecture Notes: Early Cycladic/Early Minoan [3200-1900 BCE]
- **Cycladic** = Aegean Islands (cluster of islands North of Crete)
    - **Obsidian** originated on the island of **Melos**
    - Over time Greeks further explore and populate the islands and discover minerals such as silver, copper, and lead, and lots abundances of **marble**
- **Minoan** = Crete

- **Chronology terms:**
    - On **Crete**, periods are divided into early Minoan (EM), middle Minoan (MM), and late Minoan (LM)
    - On the **Greek Peninsula**, periods are divided into early Helladic (EH), middle Helladic (MH), and late Helladic (LH)
    - On the **Aegean Islands**, periods are divided early Cycladic (EC; composed of many "groups"), middle Cycladic (MC), and late Cycladic (LC)

## Early Cycladic
- The Cycladic islands are divided into groups: **Cyclades** (main focus), Dodecanese, Sporades
    - These islands are small and have low carrying capacity (only support a few hundred people); this results in Greeks moving between islands as they exhaust the resources of the previous island they inhabited

- The previous **Neolithic revolution** resulted in...
    - Agricultural revolution (food surplus)
    - Domestication of animals
    - **Permanent settlements** (islands can now be settled long-term)
    - Leisure time
    - Secondary products revolution (milk, wool etc.)
    - Craft specialization
    - Pottery
    - Social hierarchies

- Early Cycladic time periods are less exact and divided roughly according to the artifacts/material culture recovered from various "groups" over time:
    - **Grotta-Pelos Group:** named after graveyards on Naxos (Grotta) and Melos (Pelos); characterized by abstract human figures that resemble fiddles called "fiddle-figures"
    - **Kampos Group:** named after Kampos on Paros and the evidence from this cultural phase comes from **Hagia Photia** on Crete; resembles the culture of the past however is characterized by the new addition of copper artifacts such as pins and daggers, as well as "frying pan" shaped artifacts of unknown use
    - **Keros-Syros Group:** named after the islands of Keros and Syros; artifacts are similar yet more complex/artful, introduction of "sauce-boats"
    - **Kastri Group:** named after the settlement on Syros; metalworking industry develops substantially during this period with the introduction of **casting** and **bronze** (also found at Troy, who imported it from Afghanistan where it later made its way to the Cyclades). Pottery also develops with handled "depas" cups and tankards which resembles existing pottery from Anatolia (evidence of growing trade relations in Greece)
    - **Phylakop I Group:** named after Phylakopi on Melos; architecture becomes more complex with the construction of multi-room houses. Settlements also become increasingly fortified during this time (evidence of the possibility/fear of combat between settlements, and the presence of leaders to organize these defensive projects)

- One of the most prominent artifacts during this period are **figurines**
    - Controversy

## Early Minoan
- **Minoan Palatial chronology:**
    - **Prepalatial (EMI-MMIA; 3200-2000 BCE)**
    - Protopalatial/First Palace Period (MMIB-MMIIIA; 2000-1750 BCE)
    - Neopalatial/Second Palace Period (MMIIIB-LMIB; 1750-1550 BCE)
    - Final palatial/Third palace period (LMII-LMIIIB; 1550-1200 BCE)
    - Postpalatial (LMII-LMIIIC; 1550-1250 BCE)

- Crete during the Prepalatial sees the cultivation of crops, livestock, grapes & olives

- Island of Crete is three times the size of Crete and has **difficult topography**; mountains running across the middle of the island limiting settlements to low hilly areas as the lowest areas are too marshy

- Artifacts found on Crete suggest that there was **trade** between other places (Ex: obsidian coming from Milos , copper and gold coming from elsewhere)

- **Material culture through periods:**
    - EMI: new styles and variety of earlier neolithic ceramics
    - EMII: emergence of vessels that have **spouts**; suggest contact with other parts of the Aegean world
    - EMIII/MMAI: further complexity in material culture, society is growing and becoming more technically advanced, buildings become more complex having multiple rooms and indicating the need for private areas
        - Evidence from this period is found at the larger settlements at **Knossos, Myrtos, and Photostat** and **burials**
        - Burial rituals become more complex, featuring multi-room tombs, cave tombs, kinship group burial pits; indicates a growing respect for the dead/afterlife, and social differentiation (some tombs are more lavish than others)

# Lecture Notes: Early Helladic [c. 3200-1900 BCE]
- Knowledge of the early Helladic periods is based off of one site, **Lerna**
    - EHI: continuity with earlier Neolithic, mud-brick and stone architecture begins to be prevalent
    - EHII: new population moves into Lerna (and other places); new kinds of ceramics such as sauce-boats (similarities to Cycladic and Minoan material culture, evidence of trade relations), more metal production (notably copper)
