## History of Sparta
- **Timeline:**
    - Second half of 10th century: Sparta founded
    - Late 8th century: Great Rhetra promulgated
    - Circa 690–670: First Messenian War, Theopompus king
    - Circa 630–600: Second Messenian War, Tyrtaeus active
    - Mid-6th century: Wars against Argos and Tegea; Peloponnesian League founded

- Developed a **unique government (dual kingship)**
    - Two kings from two distinct houses, the **Agiads** and the **Eurypontids**, reigned at any given point in time

- Also developed an **unique three-tiered social structure**
    1. **Spartiates** = full citizens; political rights
    2. **Perioeci** = free citizens; free but with no political rights
    3. **Helots** = "between free and a slave"
        - Helots, despite being "slaves", were allowed to keep one half of the food they farmed and more importantly they had the right to **inalienability** (right to a home in Sparta; cannot be traded or displaced)
        - Helots were required to were special clothing and were spied on by the **Crypteia** (Helot secret police)

- **Sparta goes by two names:**
    - Sparta = strictly just the physical city only
    - Lacedaemon/Laconia = the city and its territory in a political sense
        - Thus the free population (Spartiates and Perioeci) are called **Lacedaemonians**

- **Two problems in reconstructing the history of Sparta:**
    1. Lacedaemonian society was often viewed in idealistic terms leading to a somewhat **mythologized history** (becoming more pronounced in later sources) i.e. **less reliable**
    2. Most comprehensive accounts of Lacedaemonian society are found in later sources, such as **Plutarch’s biography of Lycurgus** (legendary lawgiver to whom the Lacedaemonians ascribed all their laws, customs, and institutions)

## The Messenian Wars & Helots
- Messenia lies to the west of Mt. Taÿgetos located in the southwest plains of the Peloponnese
- Over the course of the seventh century, Sparta conquered this entire region in the two so-called Messenian Wars

- The second Messenian War was fought, very roughly, circa 630–600 BC, while the first War took place two generations earlier, circa roughly 690–670 BC

- The Lacedaemonian poet **Tyrtaeus** lived in the time of one Messenian War, and his poetry makes it clear that another earlier war had taken place
    - He stated that the first war occurred during the reign of King Theopompus and during the lifetime of the current combatants’ grandfathers
    - He also references a mountain (Mt. Ithome), alluding that the location the war may have taken place at the plain of the upper Pamisus

- The second Messenian War began when those conquered in the first war revolted
    - These rebels were allegedly helped by the Pylians and Methonaeans to the west and south according to **Pausanias**; probably true because these states were later annexed by Sparta after the war

- The Messenian wars resulted in Sparta **doubling** its territory making it the **largest state in Classical Greece**
    - The Lacedaemonians also acquired a great number of conquered people whom they reduced to the status of Helots
- After the wars (mid-sixth century), the Lacedaemonians turned their attentions eastwards fought Argos for the regions lying to the east of Mt. Parnon, **the Thyreatis and the Cynuria**, gaining an important seaport in the process

- After conquering the Thyreatis and Cynuria, Sparta also defeated the Arcadian city of Tegea to the north of the Laconian Plain however **instead of annexing and reducing the citizens to helots, Sparta formed an alliance with the Tegeates**, starting the first in a series of alliances that would come to form the **Peloponnesian League**

## The Peloponnesian League
- The Peloponnesian League = **"the Lacedaemonians and their allies"**; premier military alliance in Greece that allowed Sparta to conquer the Peloponnese

- Smaller communities would enter **defensive pacts** with Sparta, providing protection however requiring that the smaller state follow Sparta into war
    - Other clauses states had to abide included not negotiating with enemies, and not accepting exiles Sparta had deemed had done "wrongful activities"

- However not every community that joined the League was tiny, some held more independence and could resist Sparta's leadership more overtly
    - Notably example of such as state is **Corinth**, who were a large and wealthy colonial state with an army and navy who due to their independence, and refused to follow the Spartans on several occasions

- League decisions, such as to go to war, were decided through a simple majority vote of city delegates

- **The role of Sparta's two kings evolved over time**
    - In the early period both kings led the troops however after a dispute only one king led troops at a time

- **Eventually the Peloponnesian League came to include almost all the communities on the Peloponnese, Argos being the outlier due to the dispute for Thyreatis and the Cynuria**

## The Great Rhetra
- The Great Rhetra = **earliest attested constitution of a Greek state (Sparta)**

- The **"Gerousia"** = Spartan council of elders; those on the council
- The Rhetra mentions **"phyle"** and **"obe"**:
    - **Phyle** = a tribe; i.e. the three Dorian tribes of the Hylleis, Dymanes, and Pamphyli
    - **Obe** = a geographically based subdivision of the Lacedaemonians (meaning people of all three phylai lived in a given geographically defined obe)
- Two landmarks **"Babyca"** and **"Cnacium"** are mentioned, presumably being the location where the assembly took place
- The **"rider"** = an individual who dismisses the council if an amendment is proposed that could challenge the elders

- After the fifth century, kings continued to reign in Sparta however had lost most of their political power, and a college of five officials called **ephors** had become the leading executive government of the Lacedaemonians

## Lacedaemonian Society
- The **agoge** = military and athletic training program for Spartiate boys designed to produced professional soldiers who lived off the other half of food that the Helots produced working for them
    - Many details describing training conditions in the agoge were likely exaggerated or mythologized so little is known for certain

- Spartiate males were also enthusiastic **singers and members of choirs** meaning there is a large artistic side to the society that is seldom emphasized
- Spartiates of both genders also underwent rhetorical training, **the art of the “comeback”** for which they were renowned
