# HIST223 - Week 7: Rise of Persia & The Persian Wars

# Lecture Notes: Persian Empire [550-500 BC]
- In Persia a dualistic worldview/religion is founded called **Zoroastrianism**
    - Based on the dichotomy between **Ahuramazda** (representing light, truth, good) and **Ahriman** (representing dark, lies, evil)

## Persian Expansion in Europe and the Marathon Campaign
- Each generation of Persian leaders added to the rapid expansion of the Persian empire

- Key figure: **Cleomenes**
    - Demaratus

- Persia advanced on the Athenians while the Spartans were engaged in a religious festival and were forced to attempt to repel the force alone

- Persia's military power was in its archers and cavalry, while Greece's was in heavily armed infantry called **hoplites**
    - The hoplites were vulnerable to arrow fire from afar, and cavalry attack from the rear and sides. Victory depended on them closing in on the archers while also avoiding constant cavalry attack
    - **Miltiades the Younger** had a plan, knowing that the cavalry required time to establish their positions he planned for the hoplites to thicken their ranks at the flanks and advance upon the archers "at a run" before the cavalry divisions had time to establish themselves; while risky, the plan worked effectively
    - After the Athenian victory they piled the dead Persians into a large collected grave called the **soros**

## Athens & Aegina
- After the Persian invasion at Marathon Greeks assumed the Persian threat was over and turned to infighting betweens states once again
    - Athens and Aegina quickly turned back to fighting and while Aegina had the upper hand initially, Athens came into a large sum of silver and used the wealth to build a fleet of 200 **triremes**
    - While the warships were primarily meant to combat Aegina's formidable naval power, they became ready just the real Persian invasion began

## Xerxesâ€™ Invasion
- Xerxes was very different to the Persian conquerers that came before; he prepared slowly, took few risks, and focused much more on stability rather than volatile expansion
    - Land and sea forces were coordinated, canals were created, etc.
    - Downside of this thoughtful preparation was that it made the Persian invasion obvious and gave the Greeks time to prepare; old quarrels were patched up (Athens and Aegina), armies and fleets were also made to coordinate, united command was given to the Lacedaemonian

- While Greek historians overestimated the Persian forces, it is clear the Greeks were still vastly outnumbered (evident by the fact the Greeks opted for a defensive strategy)
