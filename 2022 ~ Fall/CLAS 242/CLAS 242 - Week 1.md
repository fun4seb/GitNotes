# CLAS 242 - Week 1: Historiography and the Beginnings of Roman Republic
- Basics:
    - BCE = Before the common era (equivalent to BC = before Christ)
    - CE = Common era (equivalent to AD = Anno Domini)
    - Centuries:
        - 2nd century BCE = 199-100 BCE
        - 1st century BCE = 99-1 BCE
        - 1st century CE = 1-99 CE
        - 2nd century CE = 100-199 CE

# What is the Roman Republic
- Covered in this class: history of Rome until the Roman Empire gets going

- Periods: (traditional dates)
    - Monarchy: 753-509 BCE
    - Republic: 509-31 BCE (or 27 BCE or...)
    - Empire: 31 BCE – 476 CE

- **Republic** = political system developed over time by the Romans which involves the people
- **“empire”** (a state having authority over other peoples) vs **“Empire”** (political system headed by an Emperor)

# History vs. Historiography
- History: 
    - What happened?
    - Why did it happen?
    - What were the consequences of it happening?

- Historiography:
    - How do we know what happened?
    - How can we interpret what the sources are telling us?
    - What can we understand about the people writing history?

# Sources of Knowledge
- Archaeology
- Inscriptions
- Written documents
    - Papyri
    - Transmitted texts

## Archaeology
- Forms of archaeology:
    - Monumental building
    - Landscape archaeology
    - Material culture
    - Works of art

- What kinds of things can it tell us?
    - What spaces looked like and how they were used
    - How people lived
- What kinds of things can’t it tell us?
    - Specific events, narratives
    - Anything without physical presence
- What issues are there with our data?
    - Accidents of survival
    - Interpretation

## Inscriptions (epigraphy)
- Types of inscriptions:
    - Funerary inscriptions
    - Laws
    - Imperial pronouncements

- What kinds of things can it tell us?
    - What people wanted others to read – politics, being remembered, etc.
- What kinds of things can’t it tell us?
    - What people didn’t want others to know or what they didn’t think to write down
- What issues are there with our data?
    - Limited kinds of information

## Written Documents
- Forms of written documents:
    - Histories

    - Biographies
    - Letters

- What kinds of things can they tell us?
    - Historical narratives

    - Values, beliefs, etc. 
- What kinds of things can’t they tell us?
    - What authors didn’t know
- What issues are there with our data?
    - Perspective of authors
    - Exclusion of categories of people from being writers
    - Transmission issues


### Transmitted Texts
- Except under certain conditions, papyrus disintegrates (no paper until 700s CE, little parchment)
- Texts need to be **copied** into a new scroll or codex (what we think of as a book)
    - Monasteries kept and copied books we still have today

- **Bottlenecks** (periods where copying and reading texts was not prioritized so information from these periods is limited due to lack of interests): 4th c CE, 10th c CE 
    - “Texts perished, not because pagan authors were under attack, but because no one was interested in reading them.” (Reynolds and Wilson)

### Palimpsests
- Because parchment was valuable, reuse; this means writing over, or in the margins of, previous texts
- Modern techniques are required to read them and uncover the layers of writing

### Papyri
- Most writing was written on papyri (type of reed)
- Mostly 2 conditions where papyrus survives:
    1. Middle East/Egypt, dry conditions, often in garbage piles (written mostly in Greek, mostly not literary; things like shopping lists, etc.)
    2. When something is buried in ash or sand; Ex: Herculaneum (scrolls were covered and carbonized during eruption of Mt. Vesuvius)
        - Difficult to unroll
        - Ink fades upon exposure to air
        - Requires imaging to read blackened unrolled scroll
        - ‘Virtual unrolling’; X-ray phase-contrast tomography to see indentations/bumps for letters, software to arrange them

### Accidents of transmission
- Aeschylus: 7 plays extant
- Sophocles: 7 plays extant
- Euripides: 19 plays extant
    - Alcestis, Andromache, Medea, Trojan Women, Phoenissae, Orestes, Bacchae, Rhesus, Cyclops, Suppliant Women, Electra , Hippolytus, Hecuba, Helen, Heraclidae, Heracles, Iphigenia at Aulis, Iphigenia among the Taurians, Ion
    - Sometimes things are preserved for random reasons (Ex: sometimes an extra alphabetical volume of one’s plays starting with H’s are preserved by chance)

- Extant = surviving

# When Reading Authors
- The myth of objectivity
    - All people have their own experiences and viewpoints
    - Not necessary to discard writings due to those experiences and viewpoints, just keep them in mind and account for them
- Genre
    - What are the concerns of the genre the author is writing in?
- Context

# Narrative History
- Q. Fabius Pictor
    - Writing around 215-200 BCE, in Greek, not extant
    - Senator
    - First roman writer detailing history of Rome (no surviving texts, however was referenced by others)

- Annalistic tradition
    - History by the year – information from political and religious records?
    - Cato the Elder, Origines (fragments only)
    - Many later writers including Licinius Macer (fragments only)
- Poetic tradition
    - Ennius – Annales from founding of Rome to Punic Wars, some fragments extant
    - Naevius

# Where did Information come from?
- Earliest writing in the late 200s BCE, how did they know about what happened 500 years earlier?
    - Importance of family traditions in Roman culture, imagines
        - Emphasis on certain families, those influential in the Late Republic
    - T.P. Wiseman: historical plays
        - Dramatic quality of stories with heroes and villains, clear interest in narrative 

# T. Livius (aka Livy)
- Lived 59 BCE – 17 CE (approx)
- From Patavium in northern Italy
- Wrote under the Empire - personal contact with Augustus and future emperor Claudius
- Ab urbe condita/From the founding of the city: 142 books total (1-10 and 21-45 survive), plus summaries 

# Thursdays Reading Questions
- What do the stories Romans tell themselves about their origins tell us about Roman thoughts, values, beliefs at the time the history was written down?
- What was important to the Romans? 

# Cato the Elder, On Agriculture (early to mid 100s BCE)
> It is true that to obtain money by trade is sometimes more profitable, were it not so hazardous; and likewise money-lending, if it were as honorable. Our ancestors held this view and embodied it in their laws, which required that the thief be mulcted double and the usurer fourfold; how much less desirable a citizen they considered the usurer than the thief, one may judge from this.  And when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: "good husbandman, good farmer"; one so praised was thought to have received the greatest commendation.  The trader I consider to be an energetic man, and one bent on making money; but, as I said above, it is a dangerous career and one subject to disaster.  On the other hand, it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come, their calling is most highly respected, their livelihood is most assured and is looked on with the least hostility, and those who are engaged in that pursuit are least inclined to be disaffected. And now, to come back to my subject, the above will serve as an introduction to what I have undertaken. [...]

> When the master arrives at the farmstead, after paying his respects to the god of the household, let him go over the whole farm, if possible, on the same day; if not, at least on the next. When he has learned the condition of the farm, what work has been accomplished and what remains to be done, let him call in his overseer the next day and inquire of him what part of the work has been completed, what has been left undone; whether what has been finished was done betimes, and whether it is possible to complete the rest; and what was the yield of wine, grain, and all other products. Having gone into this, he should make a calculation of the labourers and the time consumed. If the amount of work does not seem satisfactory, the overseer claims that he has done his best, but that the slaves have not been well, the weather has been bad, slaves have run away, he has had public work to do; when he has given these and many other excuses, call the overseer back to your estimate of the work done and the hands employed.
