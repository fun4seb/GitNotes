# CLAS 341 - Week 1: Hellenistic Era Introduction & Alexander of Macedon
- “Hellenistic”
    - The term “hellenistic” is derived from the ancient Greek verb, “hellenizo”.
    - “Hellinizo” may be translated as “I behave like a Greek”, “I adopt Greek ways”, “I speak Greek”.
    - Ultimately, “hellinzo” is derived from the collective name the ancient Greeks gave themselves, “Hellenes”.
    - The term “hellenistic” is used to describe an historical period in which Greek culture spread to parts of the non-Greek world. This spread was given impetus by the invasion of Asia by Alexander of Macedon/Alexander the Great. 

# Ancient Primary Evidence
- We know a large amount about the Hellenistic world due to surviving primary sources

- Small selection of important surviving primary evidence of the era of Alexander:
    - Arrian (2nd c CE); Anabasis of Alexander
        - His writing is based on sources contemporary with Alexander, i.e., the works of the Greek writer Aristoboulos and the Macedonian Ptolemy, who became the ruler of Egypt
        - Very valuable source despite living later because he wrote specifically on the life of Alexander and used sources that are no longer surviving
    - Callisthenes, nephew of Aristotle and one-time official historian of Alexander
    - Nearchus, a Cretan who sailed with Alexander’s royal fleet

- Other relavent ancient authors:
    - Diodorus Siculus (Greek), late 1st c. BCE
    - Quintus Curtius (date unknown)
    - Plutarch of Chaironia, 2nd c. CE
    - Polybius, 2nd c. BCE
    - Poseidonius of Apamea, late 2nd c. BCE to mid 1st  c. BCE
    - Appian, from Alexandria, 2nd c. CE
    - Livy, late 1st c. BCE

# Other Types of Evidence
- Inscriptions = epigraphic evidence
- Papyrus documents, most of which are from and related to Egypt, especially the city of Alexandria
- Coins = numismatic evidence
- Material remains,  including pottery, wall painting, mosaics, all types of sculpture, objects of everyday and ceremonial use, all types of architecture, all types of monuments

## Some Background of the Greek World (pre-Alexander)
- Classical era of Greek history = c. 480-c.336 OR 323 BCE
- "Polis" = city-state; plural is "poleis"

- The Greek world is made up of fragmented indipendent city states that sometimes banded together for various causes
- Despite their fragmentation they did share similar culture (language, governance structure, etc.)
- Democracy was common within city-states, however many places such as Macedon, Asia Minor still had formal monarchies

# Alexander of Macedon
- Born 356 BCE, died 323 BCE
- Established 3 kingdoms (eventually!) after Alexander’s death
    - Macedonia, which now included the Greek peninsula as far as the Isthmus of Corinth and excluded the Peloponnese
    - Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemies
    - Asia (also referred to as Syria), ruled by the Seleucids

- Note: In the years following 276 BCE, by which all of the above were established, it was the Seleucid kingdom which altered the most.

- Alexander's empire was short lived and none of his successors were able to hold all three conquered kingdoms under one rule after his death
- The death of Alexander (323 BC) is considered to be the start of the Hellenistic period

## Life of Philip II & Ascension of Alexander the Great
- Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, ruled 360/359-336 BCE
- Battle of Chaironia, 338 BCE (Philip II vs Athens & Thebes)
- League of Corinth, through which Philip II imposed his policies on most Greek poleis
- 336 BCE: assassination of Philip II at a wedding, and the **ascension of Alexander to the Macedonian throne**
- Alexander dies 323 BCE

- Philip II had a plan to build Macedon into a political and economic power over the Greek mainland through domination
- After defeating the Greek city-states of Athens and Thebes at the **Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC**, Philip II led the effort to establish a federation of Greek states (except Sparta) known as the **League of Corinth**, with him as the elected leader of Greece for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia
    - Philip intended to conquer Persia and provide land to the wandering landless men to rid them from Greece
    - Philip was likely motivated to conquer Persia for reasons of personal glory, wealth, and trade accessibility that was afforded to the Persian land

## Alexander in Greece & Asia
- Due to a **period of instability following the death of Philip**, Alexander had to campaign to quell revolts of surrounding powers before beginning his eastern campaign against Persia

- 335 BC: Alexander campaigns in Thrace & Illyria; revolt & destruction of Thebes
- 3 important battles termed **“gateway battles”** gave Alexander access to future territory to be conquered:
    1. 334 BC: Alexander begins his invasion of Asia with the Battle of the Granicus; gained him access to Asia Minor
        - Alexander, while ruthless, showed remarkable respect for his defeated enemies after the Battle of Granicus by providing allowances to relatives and burial rites to the killed
    2. 333 BC: Battle of Issus where Alexander met and defeated Darius; allowed him access to Egypt
    3. 331 BC: Battle of Gaugamela

## Companions of Alexander
- Parmenion, one of Philip’s generals
- Philotas, son of Parmenion
- Harpalus, boyhood friend of Alexander
- Black Cleitus, one of Alexander’s closest advisors; a leading cavalry officer
- Callisthenes
