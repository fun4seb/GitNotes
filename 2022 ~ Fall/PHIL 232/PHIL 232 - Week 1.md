# PHIL 232 - Week 1: Introduction & Theories of the Good Life

# Introduction
- Ethics is concerned with the question of: "how should i live?"; what makes a good life
- Human being have the capacity for rationality (ability to ask and inquire what is good) and reasonability (ability to inquire about what is right and just)
    - This makes us a **rational agent** able to be held to moral scrutiny

- **Areas of moral philosophy:**
    - Value theory: what makes a life go well?
    - Normative ethics: What are our moral duties?
    - Metaethics: what is the status of ethics?; is there objectivity in ethics?

## Value Theory
- Some questions:
    - What is a good life?
    - What is worth pursuing for its own sake?
    - How do we improve our lot in life?

- Three main value theories:
    1. Hedonism: life is well to the extent is that there is maximal enjoyment and minimal misery
    2. Desire satisfaction: life is well to the extent that we get what we want
    3. Objectivist: life goes well to the extent that we engage in objective goods

## Normative Ethics
- Some questions:
    - What are our fundamental moral duties?
    - Which character traits are virtues, and which are vices?
    - Who should our role models be?
    - Do the ends always justify the means?

- Three main normative ethics theories:
    1. Egoism: the only duty we have is to benefit ourselves
    2. Consequentialism: we have a duty to maximize the good in the world and achieve the best consequences
    3. Kantian: our duties are not focused on the consequences of our actions but the motives and feelings behind an action

## Metaethics
- Some questions:
    - What is the status of moral claims and advice?
    - Can moral claims and theories be objectively true or false?
    - Can we have moral knowledge? If so, how?
    - Is there always a good reason to behave morally?

## Moral Skepticism
- One possible view: the enterprise of moral philosophy is bankrupt, and all ethical views are equally plausible
- This view is controversial and has its problems
- Ethics may be worth studying even if it is not objective and cannot arrive at absolute truths

## Ethical Starting Points
- Everyone is morally fallible
- Friendship is valuable
- We are not obligated to do the impossible
- Children bear less moral responsibility than adults
- Justice is a very important good
- Deliberately hurting others requires justification
- Equals ought to be treated equally
- Agony is bad
- Might doesnt make right
- Free and informed requests prevent rights violation

## Defining "Morality"
- What it is:
    - Focused on the good life, our duties to others, the nature of virtue, etc.

- What it isn't:
    - Law
    - Etiquette
    - Self-interest
    - Tradition
    - Convention

## Logical Arguments
- **Argument** = a chain of thought in which reasons (called "premises") are offered in support of a particular conclusion
- **Validity** = an argument is logically valid if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion
- **Soundness** = an argument is sound if it is valid and all of its premises are true

## Moral Theory
- Moral theory = a general principle, or set of principles, that tells us what is morally right in a wide variety of cases.

- One of the central aims of moral philosophy is to assess the plausibility of competing moral theories by using rational argument.

# Theories of well-being & Hedonism
- Theories of well-being attempt to state what it is for a life to go well, and what kind of thinks make a life go better
- They seek to specific what is 

- "Hedonism" comes from the Greek "hedone", meaning "pleasure"
- Hedonism states:
    - Happiness is a combination of pleasure and the absence of pain
    - Pleasure/enjoyment is the only thing that is intrinsically good for people
    - Pain is the only thing that is intrinsically bad

## Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value
- Something is **instrumentally valuable** if it is valuable because of the goods it brings about; it is value as a means to some intrinsic value
    - Ex: chocolate, sturdy shoes, vaccinations, money
- Something is **intrinsically valuable** if it is valuable for its own sake
    - This is what the instrumental values are ultimately good for

## Physical vs. Attitudinal Pleasure
- Physical pleasure: pleasant feelings or sensations (Ex: tasting an apple, sitting in a hot tub)
    - This can't be what the hedonist has in mind as if it were, then hedonism couldn't account for the ways in which happiness intuitively makes us better off

- **Instrumental goods** are **instrumentally valuable** because they bring about something, like happiness, that is **intrinsically valuable**

# Weekly Conference Notes:
- Terminology:
    - **Argument** = any chain of thought in which reasons (premises) are offered in support of a particular conclusion; if the premises are true than the conclusion must be true (in a logically sound argument)
    - **Validity** = level of underlying logic within an argument; if the conclusion logically follows premises (regardless of their truth), then it is logically valid
    - **Soundness** = argument is logically valid, as well as factually true; when an argument is valid and true, it is **logically sound**
        - A valid argument is not necessarily sound, but a sound argument is always valid
    - **Moral agent** = beings that can control their behavior through moral reasoning, meaning they are morally responsible for their actions
        - Children and animals are NOT moral agents; immune from moral criticism
    - **Moral patient** = beings to which moral agents can have responsibility of
    - **Ethical starting points** = bedrocks of ethical philosophy to which you cannot reasonably argue the contrary; Ex: friendship is valuable
    - **Hedonism** = only pleasure is intrinsically valuable, and pain is intrinsically un-valuable; level of pleasure determines the goodness of ones life
    - **Instrumental good** = a means to an **intrinsic good** (which is intrinsically valuable); Ex: in hedonism anything that gives pleasure is an instrumental good because pleasure = happiness which is the only intrinsic good that matter

# Reading Notes: The Fundamentals of Ethics (Introduction, Chapters 1-2)

## Chapter 1: Hedonism, Its Powerful Appeal

### Happiness and Intrinsic Value
- **Instrumental goods** = things that are valuable because of the good
things they bring about
    - If there are instrumental goods, then there must be something they are good for, something whose value does not depend on being a means to anything else that is good, such a thing is worth pursuing for its own sake
    - Something that is valuable in its own right, even if it brings nothing else in its wake, Philosophers call such things **intrinsically valuable**; Ex: happiness is valuable for its own sake
    - **Instrumental values** are things that are good precisely because they help to bring about things that are intrinsically valuable

- **Instrumental goods** are **instrumentally valuable** because they bring about something, like happiness, that is **intrinsically valuable**

- The most common answer on what makes a good life is **happiness**
    - According to this view, there is only a single thing that is intrinsically good for us: happiness; everything else improves our lives only to the extent that it makes us happy
    - Likewise, there is just one thing that is intrinsically bad for us: unhappiness; unhappiness is the only thing that directly reduces our quality of life

- What is happiness?
    - One answer that has attracted the most attention is **hedonism** ("pleasure"); According to hedonists, happiness is the combination of pleasure and the absence of pain; so, for hedonists, a life is good to the extent that it is filled with pleasure and is free of pain

- 2 fundamental kinds of pleasure:
    - Physical/sensory pleasure
    - Attitudinal pleasure (enjoyment)

- As the hedonist understands it, happiness is attitudinal pleasure: the positive attitude of enjoyment; being happy does not necessarily feel like anything as there is no special sensation or physical quality associated with happiness
    - Therefore (contrasting common views of hedonism), hedonism must be understood as: **enjoyment, rather than physical pleasure, is the key to the good life**
    - Happiness = enjoyment

### The Attractions of Hedonism
- Epicurus argued that the most pleasant condition is one of inner peace
    - The ideal state of tranquility comes largely from two sources: moderation in all physical matters, and intellectual clarity about what is truly important

- John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), English Hedonist Philosopher
    - Mill argued that pleasures come in different levels of quality, and that the best pleasures for human beings were those that come only through hard work, especially the work of the mind
        - Intellectual and artistic pleasures topped his list
        - physical pleasures were at the bottom

- If hedonism is true, then happiness directly improves one’s welfare, and sadness directly undermines it.

### There Are Many Models of a Good Life
- There are a variety of ways to live a good life, and hedonism explains why this is so: there are many paths to happiness

- Hedonism offers us a kind of flexibility that some of its competitors lack
    - Many of these competitors identify a kind of activity, such as doing philosophy, as the greatest good; They then say that those who don’t pursue it, or who pursue it badly, are unable to lead a good life
    - Hedonism rejects all such approaches; The best activity for human beings is the one that brings us the greatest happiness, however individual and unique that may be

### Argument Against Hedonism
- Philippa Foot, a contemporary philosopher who rejects hedonism, remarks a conversation with a doctor how observed that a lobotomized individual was happy all do long picking up leaves
    - If this person was happier than most others despite being lobotomized, then should everyone get lobotomized to improve their well-being?

- The take-away from this point is that happiness is not the be-all end-all of a good life; **there must be more to a good life than pure happiness 24/7**

## Chapter 2: Is Happiness All that Matters
- Paradox of Hedonism Argument:
    1. If happiness is the only thing that directly makes us better off, then it is rational to directly pursue it
    2. It isn’t rational to do that (meaning sometimes happiness eludes the people who seek it most intently/directly)
    3. Therefore, happiness isn’t the only thing that directly makes us better off

- The bottom line is that even if happiness is our greatest good, it may be irrational to aim for it directly
    - It doesn’t challenge the idea that happiness is the only thing of intrinsic value. It just tells us that aiming directly for happiness is not a smart way to get it

### Evil Pleasures
- Some people enjoy doing awful things, But when such enjoyment comes at someone else’s expense, it hardly seems a good thing, much less the best thing

- Argument of Evil Pleasures:
    1. If hedonism is true, then happiness that comes from evil deeds is as good as happiness that comes from kind and decent actions
    2. Happiness that comes from evil deeds is **not** as good as happiness that comes from kind and decent actions
    3. Therefore, hedonism is false

- Hedonists think that the same amount of happiness, no matter its source,
is **equally beneficial**; moral equivalence between sources is irrelevant
    - According to hedonism, happiness gained from evil deeds can improve our lives just as much as happiness that comes from virtue. In this sense, happiness derived from evil deeds is as good as happiness that comes from virtue—each can contribute to our well-being just as much as the other; **Hedonists therefore reject premise 2**

### False Happiness
- An Argument of False Happiness:
    1. If hedonism is true, then our lives go well to the extent that we are happy
    2. It’s not the case that our lives go well to the extent that we are happy; those whose happiness is based on false beliefs have worse lives than those whose happiness is based on true beliefs, even if both lives are equally happy
    3. Therefore, hedonism is false

- Hedonists deny this; Happiness is happiness, regardless of its
source, meaning Hedonists accept the first premise but reject the
second

- Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick's thought experiment of the "experience machine"
    - One person lives a happy life inside a fake simulation without their knowledge
    - Another person lives an equally happily life but in the real world
    - Most would then say the second life, the one that is both happy and true, is more desirable; A good life is one that is happy, yes, but our happiness must also be based in reality

### The Importance of Autonomy
- People want to make their own choices regarding their life; they want **autonomy**

- preserving our autonomy is vitally important, even if it doesn’t always make us happier
