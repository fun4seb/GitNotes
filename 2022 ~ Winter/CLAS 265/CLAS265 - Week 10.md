# CLAS265 - Week 10: The Epic of Gilgamesh
- Class covering the **Epic of Gilgamesh**
    - Babylonian myth originally inscribed on clay tablets
    - Gilgamesh was regarded by the people of Babylon and Mesopotamia as a real historical person

- **Main characters:**
    - Gilgamesh, king of Uruk
    - Enkidu, who becomes his best friend
    - Shamhat, a temple woman who tames Enkidu
    - Ninsun, goddess and mother of Gilgamesh; known for her wisdom
    - Shamash, god of the sun and patron of Gilgamesh
    - Humbaba, monster guardian of the Pine Forrest

- Accomplishments of Gilgamesh:
    - Said to be a great traveler who brought back tales and knowledge of his travels from the wider world
        - "He found out what was secret, and uncovered what was hidden"
        - He erected a monument in which he inscribed all he had learned
    - He built a great wall around Uruk
    - He was a great warrior and explorer who opened up passes in mountains and crossed oceans in search of immortality
    - He is 2/3 divine and 1/3 mortal

- Despite his greatness he is **not presented as a good/benevolent ruler**
    - Gilgamesh was overbearing on his people; being the "shepherd of his people" he would not leave the "sons of fathers" and "young girls" alone, "the gods often heard their complaints"
    - He is represented as a **negative figure of authority**
        - In typical hero myths there is a negative figure of authority in which the hero must defeat, however in this myth, Enkidu (rather than outright defeating) manages to "tame" Gilgamesh into changing his ways for the better

- **Creation/"taming" of Enkidu, meeting of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, and the adventure in the forest:**
    - Enkidu is presented as both human-like and animal-like (closer to animal when he is first introduced), living outside the bounds of Uruk; Enkidu lives with the animals and is a protector of nature
    - Enkidu's presence is brought to the attention of Gilgamesh by a hunter who noticed Enkidu was sabotaging the traps the hunter set
    - In order to "tame" Enkidu Gilgamesh sends out Shamhat, a temple woman/harlot, into the wilderness to have sex with him, thus "civilizing" him (making him more human than animal)
    - The sexual relations between Enkidu and Shamhat are presented as transformative acts after which Enkidu can no longer live as he did previously (like an animal); Shamhat has given knowledge to Enkidu that he didn't have, thus civilizing him
    - Enkidu and Shamhat return to Uruk, leading to a meeting between Enkidu and Gilgamesh which is at first adversarial (they meet as enemies)
    - Gilgamesh and Enkidu meet in Uruk when Gilgamesh is on his way to exercise his "right" to have sex with a newlywed woman; Enkidu is appalled at this and challenges him leading to a fight
    - After the fight they become great friends as both see within each other a "kindred spirit"; they are equal/similar in many ways, especially in strength, and this bond grows into a strong friendship
    - Enkidu grows extremely restless when he realizes he has lost some of his strength after being civilized and entering the city, causing Gilgamesh and Enkidu to decide to go on a "great adventure" in the pine forest where they plan to defeat Humbaba, the protector of the forest
    - Enkidu is originally apprehensive to this proposed adventure, fearing the wrath of the mighty Humbaba, but Gilgamesh is excited to go to test his strength, rid a monster from the land, and acquire timber from the pine forest that is guarded by Humbaba
    - Before going on this adventure Gilgamesh first seeks out the protection of the deities, gaining the alliance of his mother Ninsun and the sun god Shamash
    - While they are making preparations for the adventure the elders of Uruk warn Gilgamesh of the might of Humbaba and the danger of stepping in his forest; this is important because it shows possibly that Gilgamesh has grown since meeting Enkidu and become more tolerable to his people as they now care for his safety
    - Gilgamesh and Enkidu finally depart on their heroic journey to the pine forest; Gilgamesh has a number of dreams on the way and these are interpreted by Enkidu who has knowledge and intellect and keeps the both on track to reach their destination
    - Enkidu voices concern, asking how he is supposed to enter and clear a path through the pine forest when his arms are paralyzed (implying that there is a curse on the forest that paralyzes the arms of those who enter)
    - Gilgamesh pleads for support from Shamash, who tells him to wait for a voice from the sky to distract Humbaba, where at that point they should rush him and defeat him before he has a chance to enter the forest (if Humbaba is distracted from entering the forest the paralysis curse will not affect them)
    - With the help of Shamash, Gilgamesh and Shamash defeat Humbaba (who first pleads for his life by offering trees to Gilgamesh and asking Enkidu to make Gilgamesh spare his life, however Enkidu responds saying he must be killed); they cut off Humbaba's head to bring back to Uruk as a trophy

- **Ishtar and the Bull of Heaven, and the death of Enkidu:**
    - Begins with the return of Gilgamesh and Enkidu to Uruk (after defeating Humbaba in the pine forest)
    - Once Gilgamesh has cleaned himself from the journey he catches the eye of the goddess Ishtar, who approaches Gilgamesh with an invitation to become her lover
    - Gilgamesh responds with a very critical description of the goddess and what has befallen her previous lovers, highlighting how cruelly she has treated them
    - Ishtar is very angry at Gilgamesh's rejection and disrespect causing her to take her rage to the heavens, calling upon the god Anu to act against Gilgamesh and Enkidu by allowing her to take the bull of heaven down to earth; Ishtar also threatens to "let loose the dead" if her demand for the bull is not met
    - Her threat is effective and the bull of heaven is let loose on Uruk, causing great damage and death before it is killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu
    - The killing of the bull of heaven enrages Ishtar further, as well as an action of Enkidu (he pulled the shoulder out of the bull and slapped Ishtar with it while dissing her)
    - After the killing of the bull, Gilgamesh is instilled with arrogance (returning to his previous ways/attitude pre-Enkidu); Gilgamesh's return to arrogance is also tied up in the death of Enkidu
    - After the death of Ishtar's bull, the council of gods decreed that one of the pair must die; The impending doom of Enkidu is first brought to him in a dream and he is very bitter in his death
