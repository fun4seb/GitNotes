# Early myths of Heracles
- **Main characters:**
    - Alcmene, mother of Heracles
        - Alcmene wouldn't marry/consummate Amphitryon until he did what she asked (avenged her brothers)
    - Amphitryon, mortal step-father of Heracles
    - Iphicles, twin brother of Heracles
    - Zeus, father of Heracles
    - Hera, divine enemy of Heracles

- **Plot:**
    - Zeus disguised himself as Amphitryon and told Alcmene that he had completed the task she set for him (avenge her brothers), after hearing this Alcmene agreed to consummate her marriage with Zeus (disguised as her would-be husband); this act conceived Heracles
    - The next day Amphitryon returned home after actually completing the task and consummated with Alcmene; this act conceived Heracles' brother Iphicles
    - When Heracles is an infant, Hera sends serpents to kill him but baby Heracles strangles them
    - When Heracles is a little older, he kills his music teacher Linos (supposedly in self-defense after being struck first); because he argues self-defense he is acquitted for this act
    - After this he is sent off to Amphitryon's cattle farm (probably to keep him out of trouble), where he kills a great lion that was ravaging the cattle of the local farms; it is here that he adopts his characteristic cloak and helmet of the great lion
    - Also while at the cattle farm, Heracles killed the minions that were sent to retrieve tribute from the Thebans and their king; the way that he treated the envoy of minions led to a war between the Thebans and the minions
    - For Heracles help to the Thebans in the war against the minions he was awarded as his wife Megara

# The Labors of Heracles
- **More characters:**
    - Megara, first wife of Heracles
    - Eurystheus, king of Tiryns, for whom Heracles performs his 12 labors
    - Iolaos, nephew of Heracles who assists him in some labors

- In addition to winning his wife Megara after assisting the Thebans against the minions, he also acquired some special weapons from the gods:
    - A sword from Hermes
    - Bow and arrows from Apollo
    - A golden breastplate from Hephaestus
    - A special robe from Athena
    - He also supplied himself with a club which was his favorite weapon to wield

- **Plot:**
    - Inflicted by a madness sent by Hera, Heracles killed two of his nephews, two children of Iphicles, and three of his own children; After the madness he exiled himself, was purified by king Thespius, and then traveled to Delphi to inquire on where he should live
    - The oracle at Delphi told Heracles he should go live in Tiryns and serve Eurystheus for 12 years and perform a total of 10 labors, after which he will gain immortality (2 of the 10 were not accepted, which is why he ends up doing 12)
        - Important to note that the trophies he had to bring back to prove his labors terrified Eurystheus so much he forbade Heracles from entering the city and had him present them outside the city; Eurystheus also had a huge bronze jar made and implanted in the earth
    - **Heracles 12 labors:**
        1. Heracles killed the lion of Nemea (which he had to choke because its hide was invulnerable)
        2. Heracles and Iolaos killed the Lernaean Hydra; Eurystheus did NOT accept this labor because he had the help of his nephew
        3. Heracles captured the Cerynitian Hind after wounding it, a deer that was sacred to Artemis; he was challenged by Artemis and Apollo on his return to Tiryns however after explaining his mission he was allowed to pass
        4. Heracles captured the Erymanthian boar alive, to be placed in the bronze jar Eurystheus had placed in the ground at Tiryns
        5. Heracles cleaned the stables of King Augeias, he made a deal with the king that he could clean the stables in one day in return for some of the cattle (he was able to do this because he diverted a river to flow through the stable grounds); King Augeias wouldn't pay up when he learned he was doing this for Eurystheus, and Eurystheus wouldn't accept this labor when he learned it was done for hire
        6. Heracles killed the Stymphalian birds; Athena helped him to scare the birds out of the woods, after which Heracles shot them down
        7. Heracles travels to Crete to capture the Cretan bull (the bull was sent to King Minos by Poseidon); once he showed the bull to Eurystheus he set it free where after it ran around the mainland of Greece near Marathon before being killed by another hero, Theseus
        8. Heracles captures the man-eating mares of Diomedes; after showing Eurystheus the mares they are freed and eventually killed by wild beasts
        9. Heracles is sent to retrieve the Girdle of Hippolyte from the Amazonians for Eurystheus' daughter who wanted it; at first Hippolyte was happy to hand over the belt however Hera tricked the Amazons into making the Amazons think Heracles was going to steal their queen, this caused Heracles to kill Hippolyte and take the belt by force
        10. Heracles was sent to retrieve the cattle of Geryon (a monster with three torsos joined at the waist) who he killed; after driving Geryon's cattle back to Tiryns they were sacrificed to Hera by Eurystheus
        11. Heracles is sent to retrieve the apples from the garden of the Hesperides, who he sends Atlas to get for him; on his travels Prometheus tells Heracles that he must get Atlas to retrieve the apples for him so Heracles temporarily takes Atlas' place holding up the world, when Atlas returns with the apples he doesn't want to return to his job but Heracles tricks him saying he just needs to readjust his shoulder, this causes Atlas to take it back after which Heracles picks up the apples and leaves (eventually the apples are returned by Athens because it was not lawful to lay the apples down anywhere)
        12. Heracles is sent to capture the three headed dog Cerberos from Tartarus; after the labor is complete Heracles returns Cerberos to Hades
    - After he complete the 12 labors (of which 10 were accepted) his immortality is not bestowed upon him automatically/immediately

# Heracles & Omphale
- **Key events and characters:**
    - Eurytos, Heracles archery teacher and father to Iole and Iphitos
    - Heracles murders Iphitos, son of the archery master 
    - Heracles quarrels with Apollo
    - Heracles is sold as a slave, purchased by Queen Omphale of Lydia
    - Deianeira, second wife of Heracles

- **Plot:**
    - After Heracles completes the labors he gives his first wife Megara to his nephew Iolaos to marry as Heracles wanted to marry
    - His first choice of bride was a girl named Iole who was offered as a price for an archery contest offered by her father (the same man who taught Heracles archery)
    - Despite winning the contest Iole's father refused to give her to Heracles, concerned that he would kill their children just like he did with Megara's children; this causes Heracles to leave Eurytos' kingdom in anger
    - After some mares go missing, Iphitos (who was fond of Heracles) went to him to prove his innocence, however in a fit of madness Heracles threw Iphitos from the walls of Tiryns
    - Heracles was guilty of murder and was then purified of his crimes, despite this he "still had a terrible disease (rage/madness) that just wouldn't leave him"
    - Heracles went to Delphi to consult the oracle of Apollo (perhaps to inquire about his "disease") but Pythia (the oracle) would not speak to him
    - This causes Heracles to attempt to take matters into his own hand and found a new oracle, so he tries to steal the tripod of Apollo on which Pythia sits
    - This causes Apollo and Heracles (half brothers) to start fighting which is only stopped when Zeus throws a thunder bolt between the two of them and makes Apollo's oracle reply to Heracles
    - Pythia tells Heracles that he must sell himself into slavery for a period of three years, causing him to be purchased by Queen Omphale of Lydia
    - Heracles then serves Queen Omphale for three years; once his servitude is up he starts traveling all over again
    - He eventually ends up in Oineus' land where he tries to win as his next wife Deianeira (sister of Meleager); in order to win her as his bride he has to fight with the river god Achelous who could change his shape, Heracles eventually wins and thus gains Deianeira as his second wife
    - After marrying Deianeira he starts traveling back to Tiryns with his new wife

# Death and Immortality of Heracles
- The death of Heracles is linked to his second wife Deianeira, and his captured bride Iole, princess of Oichalia

- **Plot:**
    - On their way to Tiryns, Heracles and Deianeira come to a river that must be crossed where they meet a centaur named Nessos
    - Nessos falsely claimed that the gods entrusted him to be a ferryman, causing him to be given the task of carrying Deianeira across the river
    - While carry Deianeira, Nessos tried to violate Deianeira en route causing her to cry out to Heracles; Heracles responded to this by shooting Nessos with an arrow he had dipped in the bile of the Lernaean Hydra
    - As he was dying Nessos instructed Deianeira to collect his blood and semen to be used as a love potion if the attention of Heracles is stolen from her
    - Heracles (not forgetting Iole) returned to Oichalia where he won the archery tournament and killed Eurytos and his sons, capturing Iole and the city
    - On his way back to Deianeira he stopped to make a sacrifice to Zeus, causing him to send a herald back to Deianeira to fetch his best robe
    - When Deianeira saw the herald and learned what had happened with Iole, she brought out the robe and smeared it with the "love potion" collected from Nessos (actually hydra poison)
    - When Heracles put on the robe the hydra's poison in Nessos' blood began to work, putting Heracles in intense agony where he was then taken to Deianeira
    - Once Deianeira learned what she had done she hung herself; Heracles then built his own funeral pyre and climbed on it where after a passing shepherd lit the pyre
    - As the pyre burned a cloud passed under Heracles and carried him up to the heavens, at mount Olympos he was granted immortality and reconciled with Hera where he then married Hebe, the daughter of Hera and Zeus and goddess of youth
    - Heracles therefor becomes the only Greek hero to successfully gain immortality
