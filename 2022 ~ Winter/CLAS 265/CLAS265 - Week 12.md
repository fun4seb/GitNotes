# Myths of Bellerophon
- **Main characters:**
    - Bellerophon
    - King Priotos of Tiryns
    - Stheneboia, wife of Priotos, daughter of King Iobates of Lykia
    - Philonoe, daughter of Iobates and eventual wife of Bellerophon
    - Mythical creatures:
        - Pegasos
        - The Chimaera

- **Plot:**
    - Bellerophon comes to see King Priotos of Tiryns because he has accidentally killed his brother, causing him to possible be exiled if he is not purified by King Priotos
    - During Bellerophon's purification he and King Priotos form a guest friendship bond
    - Stheneboia (wife of King Priotos) becomes infatuated with Bellerophon and sends a written sexual proposition to him; Bellerophon, being a good guest of the King, rejects her proposition
    - Stheneboia, humiliated by her rejection then went to King Priotos and told him Bellerophon was making improper advances to her
    - King Priotos believed his wife and was thus placed in an awkward situation due to the xenia (guest friendship) established with Bellerophon; If Priotos killed Bellerophon he would be guilty of violating the guest friendship, however, in Priotos' mind Bellerophon was already guilty of violating the guest friendship
    - Due to the situation King Priotos found himself in he wrote to King Iobates with instructions for him to kill Bellerophon, sending Bellerophon as the messenger to deliver these instructions (unbeknownst to him)
    - This in turn but King Iobates in an awkward position as well because once Bellerophon was welcomed into his court delivering this message, he too established a guest friendship with Bellerophon
    - In an effort to escape the responsibility of killing Bellerophon himself, King Iobates sent Bellerophon to attempt to kill a monster, the Chimaera (creature with the body of a lion, head of a goat, tail of a serpent, and the ability to breath fire)
    - To defeat the Chimaera, Bellerophon received divine help in the form of a Pegasos (winged horse; child of Poseidon and Medusa) given to him by Poseidon (or possibly Athena)
    - Bellerophon kills the Chimaera from atop the pegasos (probably by shooting arrows)
    - Iobates is probably somewhat grateful this monster has been defeated however he is still stuck with the task of how to kill Bellerophon, because of this he sends Bellerophon on more dangerous adventures in hopes that he will be killed:
        1. Bellerophon was sent to kill the Solymoi, famed warriors of Asia Minor, which he defeated easily
        2. Bellerophon was sent against a group of Amazons, all of whom Bellerophon killed
        3. Iobates then sent his own warriors, the Lykian Warriors, to ambush Bellerophon however he killed the entire ambush party as well
    - At this point Iobates finally gave up and showed Bellerophon Priotos' letter to explain why he had sent him on all these missions, apologized, and asked Bellerophon to remain in Lykia
    - Bellerophon agreed and married Iobates' daughter Philonoe, eventually inheriting his kingdom of Lykia
    - Bellerophon's death is vague however after Philonoe bore him three children, he was said to be hated by the gods (probably for not returning pegasos and trying to reach the heavens); "he wandered alone about the plane of Aleios, eating his heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of humanity"

# Myths of Perseus
- **Main characters:**
    - Danae, mother of Perseus
    - Akrisios, father of Danae and king of Argos
    - Perseus, son of Danae after she is impregnated by Zeus

- **Plot (Perseus' early life):**
    - Story begins in Argos with Perseus' grandfather Akrisios (brother of Priotos) who is concerned over who will succeed him (he has a daughter but no sons)
    - Akrisios travels to Delphi to inquire with an oracle about an heir; the oracle replies that his daughter (Danae) will have a son that will kill him
    - In response to the oracle, Akrisios imprisons his daughter in an underground chamber of bronze thus isolating her (a common theme of an **isolated woman** leading to trouble; Ex: Io, Amymone, Atalante)
    - Zeus, violating Danae's isolation, enters her prison disguised as a shower of gold (through the ceiling) and impregnates her causing her to give birth to Perseus who she is able to hide for a few years
    - Eventually Akrisios discovers his grandson (important to note he doesn't believe he is fathered by Zeus) and decides he will cast both Perseus and Danae into the sea in a chest (variation on the theme of **exposure** where a child is cast off to die but always returns)
    - Perseus and Danae are saved by a man named Dictys ("net man") when the man washes up on the shores of Seriphos, an island ruled by King Polydectes
    - Dictys takes Perseus and Danae into his home and raises Perseus as if he was his own

- **More characters:**
    - Polydectes, king of the island of Seriphos
    - Dictys ("net man"), brother of Polydectes and rescuer of Perseus and Danae
    - The daughters of Phorcos
    - The nymphs
    - The gorgons, including Medusa

- **Plot (Perseus and his quest to get Medusa's head):**
    - After Perseus grows up, Polydectes falls in love with Danae, however this love is not reciprocated and Polydectes cannot press his intent on her as she is protected by a grown up Perseus
    - In order to get Perseus out of the way, Polydectes he gathers his friends (including Perseus) and proclaims that he wishes to marry Hippodameia (daughter of Oinomaos and already married to Pelops)
    - Polydectes then proclaims that he needs to acquire great gifts to send to Oinomaos, and that all his friends should contribute gifts except for Perseus, who he says needs to retrieve the head of Medusa (the only mortal of three gorgon sisters)
    - In order to find the home of the gorgons and Medusa, Perseus receives help from Athena and Hermes who direct him to the daughters of Phorcos (three sisters who were also sisters of the gorgons); the daughters were said to be so old from birth that they only had one eye and one tooth to share between the three of them
    - Perseus, after finding the daughters of Phorcos, kidnapped their eye and tooth and held them ransom until they gave him information on how to find the home of some nymphs
    - The nymphs were important to find because they had tools for Perseus to use on his adventure:
        - Winged sandals (possibly from Hermes)
        - A cap of invisibility (probably from Hades)
        - A satchel in which to place Medusa's head
        - An adamantine sickle (possible the one from Hesiod's Theogony)
    - After retrieving these tools he finally finds the home of the gorgons and they are luckily sleeping when he finds them
    - Perseus then decapitate Medusa by looking at her reflection in a shield of bronze (couldn't look directly at her without turning to stone)
    - When Medusa was decapitated she gave birth to both pegasos and a human-like child, the other gorgons awoke at this time as well and tried to pursue Perseus but were unable to because of his cap of invisibility and Perseus escaped, completing his mission successfully

- **More characters:**
    - King Cepheus of Ethiopia
    - Queen Cassiepeia, wife of Cepheus
    - Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiepeia
    - Phineus, brother of Cepheus

- **Plot:**
    - Queen Cassiepeia claimed to rival a group of sea nymphs in beauty (never a good idea for a mortal to compare themselves to a deity), this enraged the sea nymphs and in turn Poseidon who responded by sent a great flood and sea monster to Ethiopia
    - King Cepheus consulted an oracle who called for the sacrifice of his daughter Andromeda to the sea monster
    - As Perseus was flying home after killing Medusa, he saw Andromeda and fell in love with her, causing him to make a deal with Cepheus that if he saved her from her sacrifice to the sea monster he could then marry her
    - Andromeda was already engaged to Phineus, thus when she was saved by Perseus, Phineus launched a conspiracy against him however before it could become effective Perseus used Medusa's head to turn Phineus and his followers to stone
    - After this Perseus finally returns to the island of Seriphos just in time to save Dictys and Danae from the violence of Polydectes; Perseus turns Polydectes and his followers to stone with the Medusa head and then installs Dictys as king of Seriphos
    - After accomplishing all he set out to do (rescuing his mother from the sights of Polydectes, killing Medusa, marrying Andromeda), Perseus then decides that he wants to meet his grandfather Akrisios in Argos (signifying the importance of family to Perseus)
    - Akrisios learns of Perseus's wishes to meet him and (fearing the prophesy) flees to the funeral games of a recently deceased king
    - Perseus also goes to the funeral games and competes in discus, however when he throws his disc he accidentally strikes Akrisios in the foot and kills him
    - Perseus becomes very remorseful of this accidental killing and despite the throne being open to Perseus he refuses to succeed his grandfather in Argos
    - Perseus solves this issue by trading the throne of Argos for Tiryns that was being ruled by his cousin Megapenthes; in Tiryns, after Perseus returns all the items he used in his adventure including the Medusa head, Perseus and Andromeda lived out the rest of their lives happily (having many children and being placed among the stars by Athena after their death)

- **Notes about Perseus as a hero:**
    - Like Heracles he had an unusual conception and a fully divine parent, this is possibly in order to recognize him and other heroes as being in some way "special" or elevated compared to mortals in a divine way, making them greater than the average man much like Gilgamesh (2/3 divine, 1/3 mortal)
    - Perseus accomplishes much good on his quest to kill Medusa (saving Danae from Polydectes, saving Andromeda and killing the sea monster, replacing Polydectes with Dictys, stays faithful to Andromeda, values family as seen in his attempt to reunite with his grandfather, regretful of his accidental killing, seen to be respectful to the gods as he returns all the divine items he used throughout his journey)

# Myths of Theseus
- **Main characters:**
    - Aigeus, king of Athens
    - Pittheus, king of Troezen
    - Aithra, daughter of Pittheus
    - Theseus, son of Aithra, Aigeus, and Poseidon
    - Medea, wife of Aigeus when Theseus arrive at Athens

- **Plot (early life of Theseus):**
    - Aigeus, despite having two wives, had no children (no heir), this was a problem because his brother had fathered 50 sons (these were a threat to the succession of Aigeus)
    - Aigeus wanted a clear succession and went to an oracle to find out if he would eventually have a son; the oracle told him to "not open the swelling mouth of the wine skin, until you've come to the height of the Athenians"
    - Aigeus had no idea what this meant so he made his way back to Athens and stopped for a night in Troezen staying with Pittheus
    - Pittheus was known for his wisdom and did in fact know what the oracle meant, saying that it meant that Aigeus was fertile and ready to have a child
    - Knowing this, Pittheus got Aigeus drunk and brought him to his daughter Aithra (thinking that a child of their two great houses would be good) where Aigeus slept with her, as well as Poseidon on the same night to ensure she had an exceptional child)
    - In the morning Aigeus gave specific instructions to Aithra that if she had a son, to raise him without telling him his father, and that when he was old enough to lift a great rock (under which Aigeus placed a sword and sandals) to send him to his father in Athens
    - Theseus was born and eventually grew up to lift the rock where he got the sword and sandals left for him and was sent to Athens to meet his father (it seems he didn't know exactly who his father was)
    - The quickest route from Troezen to Athens was by sea, however Theseus chose to travel by land which was very dangerous route (probably hoping to make a name for himself); it is important to note that **Theseus idolized Heracles** and his labors on the way to Athens imitate those of Heracles
    - Medea recognized Theseus when he finally arrives in Athens, however convinced her husband she was plotting against them, causing Aigeus to send Theseus to confront the bull of Marathon (hoping that the bull would kill him), however Theseus killed the bull and sacrificed it to Apollo
    - The second attempt to get rid of Theseus was when Medea poisoned his drink at a feast, however before drinking it Theseus presented his sword to Aigeus causing him to recognize it as the sword he left for him under the rock; Aigeus then saved Theseus from the poison and Theseus banished Medea for her treachery

- **More characters:**
    - Minos, king of Crete
    - The Minotaur, child of Pasiphae, queen of Crete, and a bull sent to Minos from Poseidon
    - Ariadne, daughter of Pasiphae and Minos
    - Daidalos, Athenian craftsman resident in Crete

- **Plot (Theseus and the Minotaur):**
    - At the time Aigeus is forced to send 7 young men and 7 young women from Athens to King Minos of Crete to be placed in a labyrinth to feed a Minotaur that lives below and threatens Crete
    - Theseus, either through volunteering or by being placed on the list of tributes, gets sent as one of these tributes to Crete
    - In Crete, Theseus receives help from Ariadne who falls in love and agrees to help him survive the labyrinth if Theseus takes her back with him to Athens
    - Ariadne, following the helpful advice of Daidalos, gives Theseus a spool of thread to allow him to lead himself back out of the labyrinth after he defeats the Minotaur
    - Once Theseus is in the labyrinth he beats the Minotaur to death with his fist (according to Apollodorus) and he is able to free himself and his Athenian companions from the labyrinth by following the spool given to him by Ariadne
    - After leaving the labyrinth Theseus and Ariadne, as well as the other Athenian tributes, leave Crete immediately and make sail for Athens
    - En route to Athens they make a stop at the island of Naxos where Dionysus falls in love with Ariadne and they have four children together while Theseus carries on to Athens (in another version Theseus simply just leaves her on the island before moving on)
    - Before Theseus ever left for Crete Aigeus advised him to change his sails from black to white if he was returning alive, however on Theseus' return he forgot to do this and as Aigeus saw the black sail approaching he threw himself from the Acropolis thinking Theseus had died
    - This left the way for Theseus to become the king of Athens, and after being instated as king, Theseus kills his 50 cousins

- Why did Theseus forget to change the sails?
    - There is a version where, much like him forgetting Ariadne on Naxos, he simply forgot; this possibly points to a character flaw of forgetfulness
    - There is another version where Ariadne curses Theseus after leaving her on Naxos for breaking his sworn oath to her, causing him to forget to change the sails

- Theseus' death:
    - "Hercules brought Theseus back to earth (after he went to the underworld to steal Persephone), and sent him to Athens. He was driven from there by Menestheus, and went to Lycomedes, who threw him into an abyss and killed him"
