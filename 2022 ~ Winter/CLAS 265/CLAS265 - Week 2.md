# CLAS265 - Week 2: Hesiod's Theogony
- First few myths are concerned with **creation**; creation of life/universe/gods/etc.

- Greek creation poem detailing the systematic creation of the universe and the genealogy of the gods
    - Also refereed to as the Olympian Creation Myth (due to its focus on the accounts of the Olympians Ex: Zeus)

- Hesiod's Theogony has an **etiological function** (seeks to explain how to universe came to exist); a fictional narrative that explains why something is the way it is

- **The spelling of Ancient Greek names:**
    - Gaia = Gaea
    - Tartaros = Tartarus
    - Ouranos = Uranus
    - Kronos = Cronus

# Creation of the Universe
- Chaos is perceived as a great **void/abyss** from which **Gaia (Earth)**, **Tartarus (Hell)**, and **Eros (love)** emerged; Chaos as the starting point in the creation of the universe
    - The universe is created from the bottom up as Tartarus emerges to sit on top of Chaos and Gaia to sit on top of Tartarus
    - Who is Eros?
        - Force of **love** among gods

- From Chaos is then born **Erebos (gloom of Tartarus)** and **Night**, who lay together to create Aither and Hemera

- Gaia, Tartarus, Erebos, and Night each represent an aspect of the **physical universe**
    - In addition to this they are also **anthropomorphic beings (human like)**
        - Ex: They can lay together to create new life 

# Methods of Godly Reproduction
- **Parthenogenesis** = Creation of new life by a female only; miraculous conception
    - Ex: Gaia's three children are produced this way

- **Hieros Gamos** = "Sacred/holy marriage", refers to the creative (sexual) union of gods and goddess
    - Ex: Union of Erebos and Night (brought together by Eros)

# Children of Gaia
- **Ouranos**
    - Gaia also produces children with Ouranos (non-parthenogenically)
- The Hills
- Pontus

- These children were produced **parthenogenically** (made by female only)

## Children of Gaia and Ouranos
- The **(12) Titans**
    - Human-like beings, most important of which is **Kronos**
- The **(3) Kyklopes/Cyclopes**
    - One eyed, or "wheel-eyed" creatures of great strength and size
- The **(3) Hundred-Handers/Hecatonchires**
    - Described as "most terrible" and hate their father (Ouranos)

- This family is the most important in the narrative as their conflict 

- Ouranos's poor treatment of Gaia and his children leads to the first main conflict in Hesiod's Theogony
    - Every time a Hundred-Hander was about to be born out of Gaia, Ouranos would push them back inside Gaia and not let them out (source of their hate)
    - This caused **Gaia to conspire against Ouranos**
        - She made a sickle out of flint and told her plan of revenge to her Titan children, whom of which **Kronos** volunteered to carry out the deed
        - Her plan is to **hide Kronos** to ambush Ouranos; when he tries to lay with Gaia, Kronos will emerge and **castrate him** with the sickle
    - The **castration of Ouranos** is a violent but important act with significant consequences
        - The genitals of Ouranos, after being chopped off, ends up in the sea where it is surrounded by sea-foam, from which a girl emerged to form the goddess of love and beauty **Aphrodite**
        - After the castration Ouranos retreats to his rightful place (the starry skies), his departure allows for "space in which all others may flourish"

# The (Original) Olympians
- Deity children of Rheia and Kronos:
    - Hestia
    - Demeter
    - Hera
    - Hades
    - Poseidon
    - Zeus

- The actions of Gaia and Ouranos are later repeated by their Titan children **Kronos and Rheia**:
    - Kronos is also a bad father and **swallows each of his children whole** once they are born (all except for Zeus, the last to be born)
        - He eats his children because of a prophesy he heard from Gaia and Ouranos, detailing his downfall at the hands of one of his children
    - Before Zeus is born, Rheia rebels against Kronos (much like Gaia) and plots to protect Zeus from being eaten by Kronos
        - Rheia descends to Earth and gets a **rock** to mimic Zeus, which is then swallowed by Kronos while the young Zeus grows stronger on Earth under the protection of his grandmother Gaia
        - Zeus frees the Cyclopes who in gratitude gives him **thunder and lightning** to be used as his weapons
    - Zeus then returns to the heavens to confront Kronos where he is forced to regurgitate his children

- After the Olympians are freed by Zeus, they wage a 10 year war against Kronos and his Titan allies
    - Zeus frees the Hundred-Handers and with their help Kronos and the Titans are pushed deep underground into Tartarus where they are imprisoned and guarded by the Hundred-Handers

- After Zeus and his allies achieve victory, **their peace is interrupted by Gaia** who joins with Tartarus to create **Typhoeus** in order to challenge Zeus
    - Typhoeus is described as a mighty one hundred snake-headed creature that rivaled the strength of gods
    - **Zeus fights with Typhoeus and defeats him**; Typhoeus is then imprisoned in Tartarus

- The Titans are then forced to share their titles and privileges with Zeus who, with the support of Gaia, is then appointed **king of the immortals**
    - Zeus then distributes titles and privileges to the rest of the gods

-  Zeus then takes his first wife **Metis**
    - It was prophesied that, much like Kronos' children, Metis would produce a child that would surpass Zeus in strength and wisdom
    - With counseling from Gaia and Ouranos, Zeus tricks Metis and traps her in his belly so that she can never produce his successor
    - This is to cement Zeus as the only one who will reign as king over the immortals and break the cycle of children surpassing their fathers
