# Lecture Notes: The Babylonian Epic of Creation (Enuma Elish)
- Epic of creation written on clay tablets
    - Other copies have been found since its discovery which differ remarkably little, alluding to the fact that it was either canonized at some point, or that there was no oral storytelling history surrounding this story and it was **copied/shared in the written medium**
