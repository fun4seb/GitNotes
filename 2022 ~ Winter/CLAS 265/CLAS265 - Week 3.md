        - Succession is natural and present in the human world and thus is present in the stories of deities
    - Reproduction

# Babylonian Epic of Creation
- Epic of creation written on clay tablets
    - Other copies have been found since its discovery which differ remarkably little, alluding to the fact that it was either canonized at some point, or that there was no oral storytelling history surrounding this story and it was **copied/shared in the written medium**

- Story details how **Marduk** becomes king of the gods and establishes order in the universe
    - Details a struggle between **chaos and order**

- **Characters:**
    - Apsu & Tiamat
        - Male and female deities of all water bodies (fresh and salt water)
        - In their waters contains all the **"germs of life"**; process of creation began when their waters mixed
        - Their union brought the gods in existence
    - Mummu
        - Adviser to Apsu
    - Qingu
        - Champion to Tiamat
    - Anshar & Kishar
    - Anu
    - Ea (Nudimmud) & Damkina
        - God of wisdom and water
    - Marduk (Bell)
        - Hero of story; most superior of all

- **Summary:**
    - At first there existed only the male (Apsu) and female (Tiamat) gods of the deep (chaotic rivers). They raised a family of gods that were so unruly that **Apsu resolved to kills them**
    - Tiamat tells Ea of the plot and he puts Apsu to sleep and kills him and comes to encompass his domain (water)
    - Tiamat changes heart and becomes enraged her mate has been killed, she recruits Qingu as her champion and decides to wage war against her children. She creates 11 horrific monsters parthenogenically in order to aid the battle
    - Ea (being the god of wisdom) learns of Tiamat's amassing forces and plans of attack and attempt to find her but fail, Anu also tries but fails
    - Marduk is then finally given the task but not before they have a ceremony to **set his destiny** and arm him with weapons
    - Marduk then traps Tiamat in a net and kills her, causing her army to fall into disarray and be defeated
    - Marduk then uses the body of Tiamat to create much of the universe (sun, moon, stars, sky, Babylon, etc.) and **executes Qingu, using the spray of his blood to create mankind**

- Idea of creation as a struggle between **chaos and order**
    - Related to the rivers (Tigris and Euphrates)
        - Association with life (provides food, water, irrigation)
        - Association with unpredictability (subject to periodic flooding); what brings life also brings destruction

- Key theme of **succession**
    - Natural process as each new generation emerges they are better than the previous; each son is superior to their father
    - Marduk, being the youngest in the line of deities, is thus the most powerful and awesome

- Development of Babylon between the rivers entails being able to **tame them** (harness their strength/energy/usefulness); this idea is present in the Epic of Creation
    - Apsu and Tiamat are representative as chaotic water bodies that provide life; clear connection to the Tigris and Euphrates

- The Epic of Creation as **religious propaganda**
    - Story created to increase the prestige of Marduk by making his exploits the most amazing

# The Theogony of Dunnu
- This myth, while briefly told, has significance as it indicates the possibility of competing versions of creation myths that circulated in ancient Babylon/Mesopotamia

- **Characters (by generation):**
    - Earth (f.) and Plough (m.)
    - Sea (f.) and Cattle God (m.) (and Furrows)
    - Flocks God 1 (marries sea, his mother)
    - Flocks God 2 (m.) and River (f)
    - Herdsman God (m.) and Pasture-and-Poplar (f.)
    - Haharnum (m.) and Belet-seri (f.)
    - Hayyashum (m.) and his sister (unnamed)

- Agricultural theme to story; agriculture activity leads to life
    - Elements of creation are thus concerned with explaining phenomenon relevant to the lives of agricultural peoples

-  **Myth of succession**
    - Details the (violent) succession of younger generations overtaking older ones; each son and daughter kills their parents to succeed them
    - Pattern of succession through acts of violence

# Ovid's Myth of Creation (in Metamorphoses)
- Roman myth of creation within an epic poem (Metamorphoses)

- In the beginning all the elements of the universe existed already in a state of **chaos**
    - Differs from the other creation myths in the sense that chaos is active; not a stagnant void of nothing

- An unnamed god then sets the universe in order, organizing the chaos, and goes on the create life on Earth
    - No mention of other deities
