# The Babylonian Myth of Atrahasis
- Myth of the planned destruction of human kind that circulated in the Near East and Mesopotamia
    - Repetitive myth
    - Begins as a story of rebellion and shifts into a story of creations

- **Main characters:**
    - The Deities:
        - Ellil
        - Anu
        - Ea/Enki
        - Belit-ili = Mami = Nintu
        - Ilawela (from who's blood created humans)
    - Mortals:
        - Atrahasis ("the extra wise"), king of Shuruppak; hero of the story

- The purpose for the creation of humans is exactly the same as in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, to **serve the gods**

- After humans are created, 600 years pass and humans grow grow too big and **loud**, enraging Ellil and causing him to **plan the destruction of humans**

- **Main episodes of Ellil's planned destruction of humanity:**
    - **Episode 1:** Ellil decides to send the "suruppu disease" against humanity; Ea/Enki advises Atrahasis to appease the god Namtara, a demonic god of the Underworld
    - **Episode 2:** Ellil decides to "cut off food supplies" for humans, i.e. to send famine and drought; Ea/Enki advises Atrahasis to appease Adad, god of storm
    - **Episode 3:** This episode is sketchier than the first two and incomplete, but essentially there is no water in the sky or earth for humans i.e. another drought; Ea/Enki's advice to Atrahasis in this episode in not clear
    - **Episode 4:** Ellil again commands that the suruppu disease be sent against humanity, along with headache and "asakku" (another physical ailment); Ea/Enki advises Atrahasis to present an offering of bread to a goddess whose identity is not clear
    - **Episode 5:** Ellil again sends drought and famine to the earth, and the asakku ("disease"); any advise Ea/Enki gives to Atrahasis is unclear; an argument between Ellil and Ea is present towards the end of this episode 
    - **Episode 6:** In this episode a decision is made to send a great flood to wipe out the human race; Ea/Enki advises Atrahasis to build a huge boat to ride out the flood and storms

- Origin of the myth is related to the periodic flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; flooding was common and thus mythologized in Ancient Mesopotamia

# Flood Myths from Greece (Apollodorus)
- Myths from Greece:
    - Deucalion, Pyrrha and the Great Flood
    - Lycaon & his sons

## Deucalion, Pyrrha and the Great Flood
- **Main characters:**
    - Deucalion, son of Prometheus
    - Pyrrha, daughter of Pandora and Epimetheus; "the first woman"
    - Zeus
    - Hermes

- **Plot:**
    - Zeus decides to eliminate the "race of Bronze" (humans)
    - Deucalion, on the advice of Prometheus, built a chest stocked with provisions that he and Pyrrha took shelter in to wait out out the flooding
    - Zeus then sends great rains to flood most of Greece, killing everyone except Deucalion and Pyrrha who floated in the Chest for 9 days
    - After the flooding, Deucalion emerged and presented an offering to Zeus, causing Zeus to send Hermes and grant Deucalion anything he wished
    - Deucalion decided he wanted people, so Zeus instructed him to throw stones over their shoulders, and all the stones thrown by Deucalion became men and all stones thrown by Pyrrha became women

- Whats missing from this myth is the reasoning behind why Zeus decided to flood; a possible reason is outlined in the story of **Lycaon & his sons**

## Lycaon & his Sons
- **Main characters:**
    - Lycaon, King of Arcadia
    - Lycaon's 50 sons
    - Zeus

- **Key terms:**
    - Xenia = "guest friendship"; hospitality customs in which a guest that presents themselves at someones home must be given 
    - Autochthony = the creation of humans from Earth

- **Plot:**
    - Lycaon's sons were said to be lacking piety (faith in the gods), so to test their faith Zeus disguises himself as a laborer and visited their household
    - They invite Zeus inside to share their hospitality and the sons slaughter a child and mix their entrails with sacrificial food and feed it to Zeus, thus violating the sacred guest-host relationship
    - This enrages Zeus and he smites Lycaon and all of his sons (except the youngest as he is stopped by Gaia)

- It is theorized that the impiety of Lycaon's sons is the reasoning behind Zeus' anger with humankind and explain why he sent the Great Flood that Deucalion and Pyrrha survive 

# Roman Myth of The Flood (Ovid)
- Ovid: ages of mankind
    - Gold
    - Silver
    - Bronze
    - **Iron** = the age to which Lycaon belongs and in which the flood occurs

- Humankind during the iron age is said to be extremely sinful compared to the older farming ages (before wealth was derived from the ground, i.e. mining)

- The Roman flood myth is an iteration upon the previous Greek flood myths featuring Deucalion and Pyrrha, as well as Lycaon and his sons

- **Main characters:**
    - Jove/Jupiter (Zeus)
    - Deucalion
    - Pyrrha
    - Themis

- **Main episodes of Zeus's destruction:**
    1. Jupiter calls and addresses an assembly of the gods and goddesses
    2. Jupiter tells the story of Lycaon and his punishment
    3. Description of the storm and ensuing flood
    4. Story of the survivors Deucalion and Pyrrha
