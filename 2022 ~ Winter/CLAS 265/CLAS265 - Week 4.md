# Lecture Notes: Myths of the Flood

    - Babylonian myth of Atrahasis
    - Flood myths from Greece
    - Flood myths from Rome
    
## The Babylonian Myth of Atrahasis
- Myth of the planned destruction of human kind that circulated in the Near East and Mesopotamia
    - Repetitive myth
    - Begins as a story of rebellion and shifts into a story of creations

- **Main characters:**
    - The Deities:
        - Ellil
        - Anu
        - Ea/Enki
        - Belit-ili = Mami = Nintu
        - Ilawela (from who's blood created humans)
    - Mortals:
        - Atrahasis ("the extra wise"), king of Shuruppak; hero of the story

- The purpose for the creation of humans is exactly the same as in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, to **serve the gods**

- After humans are created, 600 years pass and humans grow grow too big and **loud**, enraging Ellil and causing him to plan the destruction of humans

- **Main episodes of Ellil's planned destruction of humanity:**
    - **Episode 1:** Ellil decides to send the "suruppu disease" against humanity; Ea advises Atrahasis to appease the god Namtara, a demonic god of the Underworld
    - **Episode 2:** Ellil decides to "cut off food supplies" for humans, i.e. to send famine and drought; Ea advises Atrahasis to appease Adad, god of storm
    - **Episode 3:** This episode is sketchier than the first two and incomplete, but essentially there is no water in the sky or earth for humans i.e. another drought; Ea's advice to Atrahasis in this episode in not clear
    - **Episode 4:** Ellil again commands that the suruppu disease be sent against humanity, along with headache and "asakku" (another physical ailment); Ea advises Atrahasis to present an offering of bread to a goddess whose identity is not clear
    - **Episode 5:** Ellil again sends drought and famine to the earth, and the asakku ("disease"); any advise Ea gives to Atrahasis is unclear; an argument between Ellil and Ea is present towards the end of this episode 
    - **Episode 6:** In this episode a decision is made to send a great flood to wipe out the human race; Ea/Enki advises Atrahasis to build a huge boat to ride out the flood and storms
