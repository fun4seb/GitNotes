    - **Anthropogony** = a myth about the creation and development (foundation) of human communities

- Common to all foundation myths are central themes of **conflict** (often violent and leading to war)

# Theseus and Athens (Plutarch)
- Theseus was not the founder of Athens (it already existed) but a political reformer who united the countryside and established a proto-democracy within Athens/Attica

- **Legacy of Theseus:**
    - The Theseia, a yearly festival dedicated to Theseus
    - The Theseion, a grand structure in Athens said to have housed the bones of the one-time king
    - The Peisistratid tyrants who used Theseus to justify their building projects
    - Kimon, a 5th century BC Athenian politician who retrieved Theseus' bones at the advice of an oracle

# Cadmos and the Foundation of Thebes
- Thebes is often portrayed as a rival/enemy of Athens

- Thebes was founded by a migrant named **Cadmos** who came from the Phoenician city of Tyre

- **Main characters:**
    - Agenor, king of Tyre
    - Telephassa, queen of Tyre, wife of Agenor, and mother of Europa and Cadmos
    - Europa, daughter of Agenor
    - Cadmos, one of Agenor's sons
    - Athena
    - Ares
    - The serpent/dragon-son of Ares
    - The Spartoi

- **Cadmus' foundation of Thebes:**
    - The story of Cadmus' foundation of Thebes begins in Tyre where his father Agenor ruled as king
    - Agenor's daughter Europa was seduced and abducted by Zeus who was disguised as a bull and taken to Crete where she birthed 3 sons to Zeus who were later raised by the King of Crete whom she married
    - After the disappearance of Europa, Agenor sent his sons (including Cadmus) to look for her and told them not to come back until they found her
    - None of his sons were able to find Europa so they had to settle elsewhere outside Tyre
    - Cadmus, unable to find Europa, asked an oracle of the god Apollo at Delphi what to do
    - The oracle told Cadmus to forget about Europa and follow a cow and found a city wherever the cow laid down
    - After the cow laid down at the site of Thebes and Cadmus wanted to sacrifice the cow to Athena (as she as associated with the founding of new communities)
    - However, as all offerings needed water (to purify the sacrificial animal and those participating), he went to the only nearby spring which was a spring of Ares and was guarded by a dragon/serpent (possibly son of Ares)
    - After the dragon kills some of Cadmus' entourage who he sent to fetch water, he goes to the spring to kill the dragon
    - After the serpent/dragon is killed Athena tells Cadmus to plant its teeth in the Earth, after which men spring up from the ground and start killing each other
    - After the battle only 5 men are still standing who collectively come to be known as the Spartoi who become the founders/leaders of Thebes
    - By pleasing and honoring Athena (killing the serpent and planting its teeth), he dishonors Ares
    - In order to appease Ares, Cadmus is tasked to serve Ares for an "everlasting year"
    - Once his dutiful servitude of Ares ended, Athena gave him Thebes to rule

# The Foundation of Carthage
- Carthage became a great power in the Mediterranean and rival to Rome (Rome eventually destroyed Carthage)

    - Acerbas, brother of Mutto, husband of Elissa, priest of Hercules
    - Hiarbas, king of the Maxitani (local tribe on the coast of Africa)

- **Founding of Carthage:**
    - At the beginner of the story there is allusion to tension between Mutto and his brother Acerbas, causing Acerbas to hide his wealth in the Earth
    - As Mutto (king of Tyre) is dying, he appoints both his children Elissa and Pygmalion to be the rulers, however the people of Tyre give the throne solely to Pygmalion
    - Pygmalion (being greedy) then murders his uncle Acerbas (violating the laws of humanity and natural affection)
    - Elissa (who hates Pygmalion for murdering her husband) deceives him by saying she will move from her husband's home into his when in reality she is preparing to flee Tyre
