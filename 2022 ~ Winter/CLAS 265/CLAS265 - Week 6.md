# CLAS265 - Week 6: Deucalionids
- Deucalionids myths covered:
    - Oineus, Meleager, and the Hunt for the Calydonian Boar
    - Myths Surrounding Atalante

- Group of myths following the descendents of Deucalion (and Pyrrha); survivors of the great flood myths from Greece and Rome
    - In Greece, lineage/family is traced through the father; patriarchal

- The Deucalionids are descendents of Deucalion and Pyrrha
- The families in these myths were real families; people who actually existed in the distant past
    - These myths act as a **real history** of ancient Greek peoples/families in antiquity

# Oineus, Meleager, and the Hunt for the Calydonian Boar
- Story about a hunt, initiated by an angry goddess (Artemis)
    - In times of peace, hunts like this were opportunities for men to prove themselves in a competitive setting; who could kill the hunted animal first would get the "trophy" commemorating their victory

- **Main characters:**
    - Oineus, king of Calydon
    - Althaia, queen of Calydon
    - Meleager
    - Atalante
    - Cleopatra, wife of Meleager
    - The sons of Thestios, brothers of Althaia, Meleager's uncles
    - The sisters of Meleager
    - Artemis
    - Dionysos
    - Ares

- When Meleager was 7 days old, the fates (3 daughters of Zeus) appeared to Althaia and told her that **Meleager's life would end was a particular log burning on the hearth was consumed**
    - This caused Althaia to take the log out of the fire, quench it in water, and hide it away in a chest so it could not burn away (thus ending Meleager's life)
    - This means Meleager is essentially immortal as long as that log is never burned

- When Atalante was born she was exposed (left in the wild) by her father because he wanted a son/heir
    - Atalante was rescued by a she-bear who cared for her until she was rescued by a group of hunters who raised her
    - Atalante's unusual upbringing (especially for a girl) explains why she excelled at hunting, running, wrestling, fighting, etc.
    - When she came of age she refused to marry and chose to remain a virgin
    - Atalante can be considered as a double/representative of Artemis

- **Plot:**
    - Story begins with an omission on the part of Oineus; as he was offering fruits to the deities as a group he **forgot to include Artemis**, angering her tremendously
    - This caused Artemis to send huge boar to ravage Oineus' lands and peoples
    - Oineus' solution was to call together the greatest heroes from across to land to hunt and kill the boar; those called include:
        - Theseus
        - Jason (of Jason and the Argonauts)
        - Castor and Pollux/Polydeukes (Twin sons of Zeus)
        - Atalante (sole female participant); included not for her hunting ability but because Meleager wanted to father a child with her
        - The sons of Thestios
    - Many of the hunting companions are upset that Meleager included Atalante (a girl) in the hunt, but are forced to participate regardless
    - **Atalante drew first blood on the boar and Meleager struck the killing blow**; because Atalante drew first blood (or the fact that Meleager wanted to sleep with Atalante), Meleager skinned the boar and gave her the hide as a trophy
    - The fact that Meleager gave the trophy to a woman infuriated the sons of Thestios
    - **Two possible endings:**
        1. The sons of Thestios forcibly take the trophy from Atalante as they think the trophy should go to a man, causing Meleager to kill his uncles (Althaia's brothers) in order to return the trophy to Atalante. This angers his mother and causes her to put the log (that ensures Meleager's immortality as long as it is not burned) in the fire, killing Meleager
        2. An argument of who drew first blood on the blood escalates into a war between Meleager and his uncles. During the war Meleager kills many of his uncles, causing his mother to curse him if he continues. After being begged to aid his people in the war he continues the war causing his death, resulting in his mother and wife hanging themselves and his sisters mourning his death so intensely they turn into birds

- **Family dynamics/conflict:**
    - The actions of one family member affect all others
        - Oineus' failure to include Artemis in the offering implicates his entire family, especially Meleager, to solve the problem he caused (eventually leading to the death of many family members)
        - Meleager's lust for Atalante causes extreme conflict in the story, resulting in the events leading to the death of his mother, his uncles, and himself

- This hunt is an example of **initiation** for Meleager as his father presents him with the task of killing the boar to prove his manhood and capabilities as a leader

# Myths Surrounding Atalante
- **Characters relavent to Atalante's life:**
    - Rhoicus & Hylaeus (centaurs)
    - Peleus, father of Achilles
    - Melanion, suitor of Atalante
    - Aphrodite (called Venus in Rome)

- Atalante was not only a good hunter but an exceptional athlete as well
    - Ex: Wrestling match between Atalante and Peleus (Achilles' father), in which Atalante **defeats him**

- When Atalante returns to her lands after the boar hunt, her father (a king) is still without a male heir, this causes him to be eager to marry Atalante off so she can produce a grandson (heir) for the king, thus continuing his lineage

- In order to decide who will marry Atalante, a footrace against Atalante is organized; **whoever can beat Atalante in a race can marry her**
    - Those participating in the race are given an advantage (head start, they can run unarmed while Atalante is armed)
    - Atalante beats many men and kills them when she catches up with them
    - Melanion (suitor of Atalante) came prepared for the race with **golden apples** (given to him by Aphrodite) that he used to drop periodically throughout the race, causing Atalante to stop and pick them up every time she caught up with him. This resulted in Melanion winning the race and marrying Atalante

- This resulted in Atalante fulfilling her societal expectations as a women (marrying Melanion as well as giving him a child), however their marriage did not last long as during a hunting expedition they made love in a cave of Zeus, causing him to turn them both into lions
    - Greeks believed lions didn't mate with other lions so the implication here is that they could carry out the rest of their lives hunting, but not making love
    - Despite the marriage not lasting long, it did represent (through the fact that they hunted together) how Atalante did not need to compromise her way of life as a hunter despite still fulfilling the societal expectations pushed on her

- Throughout Atalante's life she exhibits a tremendous amount of agency over her love life (due to her lack of parental supervision early in life). This is exemplified in how her father must persuade her (not force her) to marry, and even so the terms of her marriage are completely up to her

- The golden apples that Melanion drops to beat Atalante symbolize love and marriage, and keeping in mind the amount of personal agency Atalante has, her choice to stop for each apple can be viewed as her accepting Melanion's love and essentially allowing him to win, thus symbolizing her approval of him
