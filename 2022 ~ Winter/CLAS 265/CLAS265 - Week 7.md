    - Poseidon then appears and scares off the satyr, before pursuing Amymone himself

        - The sons say they want to marry the daughters of Danaos (their cousins); possibly a show of dominance or a way to steal Danaos' claim to Argos and Egypt as all their sons would become heir to Aigyptos' household
    - Despite his suspicions, Danaos agrees to the marriage of his daughters to the sons of Aigyptos; he does this because he has a plan
    - After all the weddings, Danaos gives the gift of a dagger to each of his daughters with instructions to kill their new husbands
    - Every daughter kills their husband except Hypermnestra, who spares her husband Lynceus because he did not take her virginity when they married
    - The daughters perform the proper burial rituals for their dead husbands and are absolved by Zeus of their act
    - Danaos then holds a sports competition and awards the winner of each event a daughter

- Theme of returning home (the "pull" of the homeland), as well as succession ultimately leading to the sibling rivalry between Danaos and Aigyptos

# The Myth of Proitos and Acrisios Divide the Argolid

- **Main characters:**
    - Proitos, son of Abas and Aglaia, grandson of Hypermnestra and Lynceus
    - Acrisios, twin brother of Proitos
    - King Iobates of Lycia, father of Anteia/Stheneboia, father-in-law of Proitos
    - Tiryns, eventual kingdom of Proitos
    - Argos, eventual kingdom of Acrisios

- **Plot:**
    - Proitos and Acrisios both want to rule Argos after their father Abas dies
    - Acrisios takes the throne and drives his brother into exile
    - In exile, Proitos ends up in the kingdom of Lycia and strategically marries the daughter of the king, creating an alliance with king Iobates of Lycia
    - This alliance with the king of Lycia allows him to return home to Argos and claims part of the territory (Tiryns) to rule for himself
    
- Why is sibling rivalry so common in Greek foundation myths?
    - When there is only ever one throne and many descendents/sons, this almost always leads to rivalry between those who want to gain the throne
