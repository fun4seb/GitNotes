# CLAS265 - Week 8: Thebans
- Myths from Thebes covered:
    - Semele, Zeus, and the Birth of Dionysus
    - The Myth of Artemis and Actaion
    - The Myth of Dionysus' Return to Thebes
    - The Myth of Laios and Oedipus

- **Theban royal family:**
    - Thebes was founded by Cadmos, originally from Tyre in Phoenicia
    - Harmonia, daughter of Aphrodite and Ares; becomes Cadmos' wife
    - Semele, Ino, Agave, Autonoe; daughters of Harmonia and Cadmos
    - Polydorus, the son of Harmonia and Cadmos

# Semele, Zeus, and the Birth of Dionysus
- **Plot:**
    - Zeus wanted to sleep with Semele and began an affair with her
    - Zeus tried to hid this affair from his wife Hera, but she discovered it causing her to intervene in Semele's (just as she intervened in Io's life)
    - Hera disguised herself as Semele's nurse Beroe, and persuaded Semele to ask Zeus to come to her just as he came to Hera, "so that you may know how great a pleasure it is to lie with a god"
    - Semele asked Zeus to come to her just as advised and as a result Zeus came down with thunder and lightning and incinerated Semele in fire
    - From Semele's womb was born Liber (Dionysus in Greek) who was saved from the fire and given by Mercury to Nysus to be raised

- None of Semele's sisters believed Zeus was actually her lover, thus denying that Dionysus was a god (rejected the fact he was born of Zeus)
    - They believed she had an affair and fabricated the story of he being with Zeus to cover it
    - This refusal to believe her relationship with Zeus is something they will be punished for later

# The Myth of Artemis and Actaion
- **Plot:**
    - Semele's sister Autonoe married a man named Aristaeus, to whom was born Actaion
    - Actaion came across Artemis and her nymphs bathing naked in the woods (whether by accident or deliberately)
    - This enraged Artemis and caused her to transform Actaion into a deer and cause his hunting dogs to devour him

- This myth is used to indicate the vindictiveness of the goddess Artemis, the disregard she has for human life, and the extreme lengths she will go to preserve her privacy and virginity (both physical and psychological)
    - Depending on the telling Actaion is either the victim, or the transgressor as he disregards the boundary between deities and humans by trying to sleep with/marry/rape Artemis

# The Myth of Dionysus' Return to Thebes
- **Main characters:**
    - Pentheus, son of Agave and Echion, grandson to Harmonia and Cadmos (ruler of Thebes)
    - Agave, Autonoe, and (possibly) Ino
    - Euripides (wrote the play Bacchai, a tragedy following Dionysus' struggle to establish himself as a god)

- **Plot:**
    - Dionysus, still a baby residing on Mount Nysa and being cared for by the nymphs of the mountain and the satyr Silenus, is still being pursued by Hera who is still angry after the events between Semele and Zeus
    - As Dionysus reached adulthood in this wilderness setting it drove him mad, in his madness he traveled through Asia Minor to the Near East and India
    - His madness was eventually cured by the goddess Rhea, causing him to return to Greece and establish himself as a god of worship
    - When he finally returned to Thebes, it was being ruled by his cousin Pentheus (son of Selene's sister Agave and Echion)
    - Because Selene's sisters never believed she laid with Zeus they, their son Pentheus and the Theban community refused to acknowledge Dionysus as a god
    - Dionysus retaliated by driving all the women of Thebes, including his aunts, to his worship at a nearby mountain
    - Pentheus, who tried to ban the worship of this "false god", went to spy on the Bacchai (female worshipers of Dionysus), and as a result was mistaken for a wild animal and torn to pieces by the women
    - When the madness of the women fades and they realize they just tore apart their king, they finally recognize the power of Dionysus as a god of worship

# The Myth of Laios and Oedipus
- **Main characters:**
    - Laios, king of Thebes
    - Iocaste, queen of Thebes and wife of Laios
    - Oedipus, son of Laios and Iocaste
    - King Polybos and queen Periboia of Corinth
    - Creon, brother of Iocaste and temporary king of Thebes after murder of Laios
    - Ismene and Antigone, daughters of Iocaste and Oedipus
    - Esteocles and Polyneices, sons of Iocaste and Oedipus

- **Plot:**
    - Laios (member of Theban royal family) becomes king of Thebes, and marries a woman named Iocaste
    - An oracle warns Laios not to have a child because any son he has will become his murderer
    - Laios follows this advice however one night after drinking a lot of wine he has sex with his wife and she becomes pregnant, eventually giving birth to their son Oedipus
    - Laios gave this infant son to a herdsman to die of exposure on a mountain, after having pierced the infants ankles with buckles
    - The baby is found by a herdsman of King Polybos of Corinth, who delivers the baby to the King's wife Queen Periboia
    - The King and Queen were childless so they take the infant (Oedipus) in and raise him as their own
    - Oedipus grows up in Corinth as the heir to King Polybos, he also grew up to be a "very strong man"
    - When Oedipus reached manhood he was the strongest of all his peers and they accused him of not really being Polybos' son because King Polybos was gentle and Oedipus was not
    - Oedipus then went to Delphi to inquire with the oracle about who his father was, however the oracle gave him a cryptic answer, basically saying "do not return to your native land for you will kill your father and sleep with your mother"
    - (Because he thinks Corinth is his native land) he travels away from Corinth (thinking the oracle meant King Polybos was his real father) and unknowingly runs into his real father (Laios) who was also inquiring the oracle of Delphi about his death at the hand of his son
    - Laios' guards ordered him to make way for King Laios however Oedipus refused, causing Laios' horses to run over his foot, angering Oedipus and causing him to throw Laios from his chariot, killing him (thus fulfilling the oracles prophesy); Oedipus then caries on towards Thebes, with no one knowing he was the murderer of King Laios of Thebes
    - After the murder of Laios, Creon becomes the new king of Thebes where he is faced with a new problem, that being a sphinx sent to Thebes by the goddess Hera (for a variety of possible reasons, possibly still harboring a grudge against Thebes for the situation between Semele and Dionysus)
    - The sphinx asked Thebans passing by a riddle: "what is it that has a single voice, four feet, and then two feet, and then three feet"; killing any who could not answer the riddle
    - There were many dead by the time Oedipus showed up in Thebes, Creon was so desperate to rid Thebes of the sphinx that he promised the entire kingdom as well as marriage to Iocaste (true moth of Oedipus) to whoever could solve the riddle
    - Oedipus was able to solve the riddle, saying that it is humans that have four feet at birth, two feet at adulthood, and three feet with a cane in old age; this correct answer caused the sphinx to throw herself from the top of the acropolis, killing herself
    - Due to solving the riddle, Oedipus became the king of Thebes, married Iocaste, and fathered four children
    - Oedipus had thus fulfilled the prophesy set out for him (and Laios)unknowingly; he killed his father, returned to his native land, and slept with his mother

- Apollodorus is not forthcoming about how Oedipus' killing of his father and incest of his mother became revealed; the most common tradition is that:
    - A plague descends Thebes
    - Oedipus sends to the Delphic oracle to determine how the plague may be ended. The oracle reveals that the plague is due to the presence of Laios' murderer in Thebes. The murderer of the former king was never purified of the murder, and his pollution has infected the entire community
    - Oedipus begins to investigate the murder of Laios, and eventually realizes that he is the murderer, and that Laios was his biological father, and that Iocaste is his biological mother
    - The revelations cause Iocaste to kill herself, and Oedipus to blind himself

- **Freud's Oedipus Complex**
    - "The legend of Oedipus is the reaction of our imagination to these two typical dreams (dreams of making love with one's mother and killing one's father) and as, in the adult, the dreams are accompanied by feelings of revulsion, the legend has to include horror and self-punishment in its contents" (Die Traumdeutung/The Interpretation of Dreams)
        - The horror is presented with the suicide of Iocaste
        - The self-punishment is presented with the self inflicted blinding of Oedipus

- **"Oedipus and the Greek Oedipus Complex" in Interpretations of Greek Mythology (Bremmer, Jan)**
    - Bremmer starts by talking about motifs in the myths of Oedipus that are ignored by Freud
        - One of these elements that is ignored is the presence of the **oracle**, Bremmer thinks that the oracle is very important in understanding the story because it brings to our attention the issue of human intelligence vs. divine intelligence, the issue of the limitations of human understanding, and most importantly the issue of **fate vs. free will**
    - Bremmer sees Oedipus as representing many of the qualities seen in traditional hero myths
        - Bremmer points out that Freud ignores the **exposure of Oedipus**, that the early removal of an individual from his/her community highlights their **later importance as a hero to the community**
        - Freud also ignores that Oedipus is not raised in Thebes (by his biological parents), but in Corinth; Bremmer connects this to an ancient Greek aristocratic practice of fostering out male children to other aristocratic families as a part of their maturation, where they finalize their transition to adulthood as they return home a man
        - Bremmer thinks that if the story ended after he kills the sphinx and becomes king of Thebes, the story would be a pretty typical hero myth (baby left to expose, leaves home, kills monster, is welcomed by community as a result of his success)
    - Why is parricide (killing one's father) and incest so bad in Greek society?
        - There was great stress placed on honoring one's parents (particularly for male children)
        - Bremmer points at that of the few myths that include incest (sex with one's parent), there is almost always a link between incest and parricide
        - Things like parricide, incest, and cannibalism were the markers of those who were "uncivilized", and separated "civil" Greek society from the rest
    - Bremmer also points out that anyone in myth who partakes in parricide, incest, or cannibalism, does so unknowingly as perhaps the poets could not perceive of anyone doing these things out of free will
    - Ultimately Bremmer says the story of Oedipus is assembled from a variety of mythological motifs (consultations of oracle, exposure of a child, parricide, incest, monster slaying)
    - Its possible the story was told as a warning to up and coming men as they did on some level threaten their fathers' position in the community; told as a warning to respect their fathers rather than working against them, or else possibly play out the perverted series of events shown in the story of Oedipus

- Common theme of **exposure** (leaving an infant in the wild to die) present in this myth
    - Laios takes this one step further by injuring the infant Oedipus (piercing his ankles with buckles) before exposing him
    - Theme of having a future child prophesied to be ones downfall is common in myth, as well as the fathers disregarding this and placing their need for lust above the consequences of bearing a child they know to be their downfall
        - This is why so many fathers do things like swallow their children (Kronos), or even swallow the mother that could bear the children (Zeus), rather than just not having kids

- Theme of **free will**
    - Did Oedipus really have free will or was he destined to fulfill the prophesy set out before him
    - Freudian idea that Oedipus' destiny is the destiny of all men, that being that all men carry the same curse of dreaming to sleep with their mother and kill their father
