# CLAS265 - Week 9: Pelopids
- Myths covered from the Pelopids:
    - Myth of Tantalos and Pelops
    - Myth of Atreus and Thyestes

- Looking at the Pelopids over 5 generations that exemplify ideas, themes, behaviors, and consequences that were seen in other myths
    - What is repeated across myths is important; what is seen in this myth that is also seen elsewhere?

- This is the last group of myths under the larger umbrella of marriage and family
    - **Takeaway from these myths:** family is often as complicated in the human realm as it is in the divine realm


# Myth of Tantalos and Pelops
- Myths of the Pelopids are based around descendents of **Pelops**

- **Main characters:**
    - Tantalos (possibly son of Zeus)
    - Pelops
    - Oinomaos, king of Pisa
    - Hippodameia, daughter of Oinomaos
    - Myrtilos, charioteer of Oinomaos and son of Hermes
    - King Stymphalos of Arcadia

- **Plot:**
    - Favored by the gods (socialized and shared meals with them where he ate ambrosia and drank nectar, possibly becoming immortal by doing so)
    - Despite being favored by the gods he was a false friend, telling the secrets of the gods and sharing the gods' ambrosia with his mortal friend
    - He also tried to serve the gods the flesh of his son Pelops (similar to the story of Lycaon and his sons), possibly in an effort to test their omnipotence, as if they unknowingly ate the human flesh it proved they were no greater than mortal humans and undeserving of respect
    - The gods saw that they were being fed mortal flesh and none of them ate it (except Demeter who was distracted), and instead gathered up all the limbs of Pelops and placed them in a cauldron where he was reassembled and revived
    - The reassembled Pelops was to attractive he was carried of my Poseidon and when he returned the the earth with a winged chariot that could be driven through the sea without wetting it
    - Tantalos (for trying to feed the gods flesh) was sent to Tartarus for eternal punishment (unending thirst and hunger while being surrounded by food and drink that receded when he tried to reach it, as well as being threatening by physical harm as a rock teetered over him for eternity)
    - Pelops' winged chariot was very important because he used it to enter into a race against Oinomaos where if he won he wold marry Hippodameia and become the eventual king of Pisa
    - Oinomaos was reluctant to allow his daughter to marry because it was prophesied that he would die at the hands of her husband, so he organized a chariot race against suitors where he was at great advantage because he had a chariot and horses given to him by Ares
    - Oinomaos killed any suitor that failed to beat him, beheading them and nailing it to his palace wall
    - When Pelops showed up, Hippodameia fell in love with him so she persuaded Myrtilos (charioteer of Oinomaos who was also in love with Hippodameia) to sabotage Oinomaos' chariot by failing to put the axle pins in the chariot wheels
    - When the race against Pelops started, Oinomaos' chariot broke causing him to be dragged by his horses until death, all while **cursing Myrtilos** (curses is a recurring theme in myth) that he shall be eventually killed by Pelops
    - After the race, when Pelops went to fetch water, Myrtilos attempted to rape Hippodameia but failed. When Hippodameia told Pelops of the attempted rape Pelops threw Myrtilos off a cliff into a sea that bore his name
    - As Myrtilos falling to his death, he also **cursed the house of Pelops**
    - Pelops was later cured by Hephaestus and returned to rule

- In an alternate telling it is Pelops, who after fearing loosing at the sight of the suitor's heads, promised half of the kingdom to Myrtilos in return for helping sabotage Oinomaos' chariot. He figured that Myrtilos would be a source of disgrace for him to he threw him in the sea. He then lead Hippodameia back to his homeland which was called the Peloponnesus ("the island of Pelops"). There he fathered Hippalcus, Atreus, and Thyestes with Hippodameia

- In another situation, Pelops wanted to add to his kingdom but was unable to defeat the neighboring King Stymphalos of Arcadia with military force. This caused him to feign friendship with King Stymphalos and then killed and dismembered him and scattered his limbs

# Myth of Atreus and Thyestes
- **Main characters:**
    - Atreus, son of Pelops and Hippodameia
    - Aerope, wife of Atreus (however she secretly loved Thyestes)
    - Thyestes, another son of Pelops and Hippodameia
    - Aglaos, Callileon, and Orchoenos, sons of Thyestes that were killed by Atreus
    - Pelopeia, daughter of Thyestes and mother of Aigisthos
    - Aigisthos, son of Thyestes and Pelopeia

- **Plot:**
    - Atreus had vowed to sacrifice the finest lamb born in his flock to the goddess Artemis
    - A golden fleece lamb was born (or placed in his flock by Hermes)
    - Once the golden lamb appeared this was obviously chosen as the one to sacrifice to Artemis, however Atreus kept the golden fleece for himself where he placed in a chest
    - After this, the king of Mycenae dies and an oracle tells the people of Mycenae that they should choose a son of Pelops to become their King
    - Both Atreus and Thyestes (sons of Pelops) traveled to Mycenae where they were then told that the throne would be given to whichever of them had the fleece of a golden lamb
    - Atreus agreed because he did not know that his wife Aerope had given his prized golden fleece to Thyestes in secret, causing Thyestes to be named the new king of Mycenae
