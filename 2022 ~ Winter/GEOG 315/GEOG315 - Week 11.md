# GEOG315 - Week 11: Sexuality

# Lecture Notes: Geography and Sexuality
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - How do sexual norms shape social relations, including access to opportunities, resources, and safety?
    - How do sexual norms relate to geography? How are geographies shaped by sexual norms and vice-versa?
    - How do sexual norms relate to other norms, especially gender norms?

## Gill Valentine: “(Hetero)sexing Space”
- **What are norms:** informal rules that govern behavior in groups and societies
    - Sometimes we are aware of norms, sometimes we only learn about them if we defy them (Sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit)
    - Ex 1: saying please and thank you, referring to elders as “Mister” or “Missus”
    - Ex 2: the boy who walks with a “swish” (from the Judith Butler video)

### Sexual Norms and Social Relations
- What kinds of **sexual norms** operate in our society?; What are the **social consequences** of embodying or defying these norms?

- Sexual norms within our society according to Gill Valentine:
    - "Sexual/romantic relationships are between men and women"
        - Hetero couples can express affection and appear together in public, talk about their partner at work, etc.
    - "The “family” or “household” is a nuclear, hetero-sexual unit; a father, a mother, and kids"
        - Hetero families are more likely to find suitable private or public housing
        - Hetero families are more likely to get employer-based health insurance
    - "It is acceptable for men to make advances on women (Ex: in bars), and use sexual innuendo with women (Ex: at work)"
        - Lesbians can face verbal abuse from men in bars
        - Lesbians (and presumably all queer people) can be left out of social rituals at work

### Sexual Norms and Geography
- How do sexual norms shape geography?
- Gill Valentine mentions the following spaces:
    - Home
    - Workplace
    - Social spaces (Ex: hotels, restaurants, pubs)
    - Public spaces

- How are the following spaces (hetero)sexualized?
    - **Home:**
        - Housing is built for nuclear, heterosexual families. Queers find it harder to find housing or share domestic work in non-nuclear forms
        - Some cities/towns and neighborhoods are almost entirely heterosexual; Queers mostly choose not to live in such places
        - The family home assumes heterosexuality; Queers may find such spaces to be, not comforting, but alienating
    - **Workplace:**
        - Workplace benefits (Ex: health insurance) often assume a nuclear, hetero family. Queer workers often cannot share benefits with their partner
        - Workplace culture can include men using sexual innuendo with women, etc. and so Lesbians can be excluded from this (which can be good, but is also exclusionary and can impede career success)
        - Workplace culture often centers on discussions of one’s partner or family and so queers cannot easily participate in this; feel they must remain silent
    - **Social spaces:**
        - Hotels and restaurants are built around heterosexuality and so queer couples may book separate rooms, avoid B&Bs, end up seated at the back of restaurants (and stand out anyway)
        - “Public houses” (pubs) and clubs usually assume hetero-sexuality and are structured around men making advances on women; Lesbians may experience abuse from men
        - Hairdressers’ “small talk” is often about relationships, which are assumed to be hetero and so Lesbians opt for gay salons
    - **Public spaces:**
        - Public affection is heterosexualized; It is normal for hetero couples to express affection, while queers may experience verbal abuse or physical violence

- How does geography shape sexual norms (the “vice versa” of the previous question)?
    - When queerness is hidden, our models for sexuality are more limited
    - When spaces and social relations are made for heterosexuality, there are incentives to live a hetero life (if it’s bearable/enjoyable)

### Sexual Norms And Other Norms
- How are sexual norms related to other norms, especially gender norms?
- According to Gill Valentine:
    - **"Heterosexuality" assumes:**
        - 1. A binary distinction between men and women
        - 2. That “man” and “woman” map onto differently sexed bodies
    - “To be gay, therefore, is not only to violate norms about sexual behavior and family structure, but also to deviate from the norms of ‘natural’ masculine or feminine behavior” (pg. 396)

- Have Times Changed?
    - Valentine’s article was published 25 years ago; Have things changed?
    - Have sexual norms changed? Or has the power of norms diminished?

## Natalie Oswin
- Oswin examines “family” policies in Singapore
- What’s a family policy?
    - 1980's: state finds the birth rate is too low, so policies to encourage “natality” (having children) are introduced
    - This is about sexuality! And it’s necessarily about race, class, and gender as well; why natality rather than immigration?vWhose natality will be promoted? Whose won’t?

- What are the implications of Singapore’s family policy?
    - Notes “the family,” for the state, is a heterosexual nuclear one (father, mother, children) and the “foundation of society”
    - Need to see this vision as not just heterosexist, but “heteronormative” and thus sustained by sexual, racial, and gender logics (pg. 85); “Particular expressions of heterosexuality seem right” (pg. 86)
    - State “family” policies have different effects for different kinds of people. Marginalized by the policies are LGBTQ people, but also single people, single parents, and “foreign workers”

- State “family” policies have different effects for different kinds of people. Marginalized by the policies are LGBTQ people, but also single people, single parents, and “foreign workers”
- This doesn’t seem to be about sexuality, but it is:
    - “Foreign workers have no future in Singapore. They, like LGBT persons, are considered by the state to be part of Singapore's production, but not its social reproduction” (pg. 101)

## Sarah Hunt
- Hunt examines framings of gender and sexuality in settler colonial policies in Canada
- The Indian act: disenfranchised women who married a non-Indigenous man
- Residential schools: separated and “gendered” boys and girls
    - “Boys had their hair cut short, girls wore bobs and bangs, kept in different dorms in order to ingrain distinct gender roles into them” (pg. 24)

- All of this sought to erase Indigenous expressions of gender, and the non-binary category “two spirit”

## Sexuality?
- What do these articles (Oswin’s and Hunt’s) have to do with sexuality?
- Is this different than the ways we usually talk about sexuality?
- Do they suggest a different way of thinking about sexuality and geography?
