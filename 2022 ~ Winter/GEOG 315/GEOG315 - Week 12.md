# GEOG315 - Week 12: Disability

# Lecture Notes: Geography and Dis/ability
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - What are considered “normal” physical and mental abilities? How do these norms shape social relations?
    - How do these norms relate to geography? How are geographies shaped by “normal” abilities and vice-versa?
    - How do normal abilities relate to other norms?

## Normal Abilities, Impairments, and Disabilities
- **What are norms:** informal rules that govern behavior in groups and societies
    - Sometimes we are aware of norms, sometimes we only learn about them if we defy them (Sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit)
    - Ex 1: saying please and thank you, referring to elders as “Mister” or “Missus”
    - Ex 2: the boy who walks with a “swish” (from the Judith Butler video)

### "Normal" Abilities
- What kinds of physical and mental abilities are considered “normal” in our society?
    - **Sight:** can fully recognize people and objects, distinctions, colors
    - **Hearing:** can fully hear sounds and voices at a particular volume
    - **Mobility:** can walk upright at a certain speed, including ascending and descending
    - **Cognition:** can recognize written language, can understand and express information in written, symbolic, and oral forms
    - **Mental:** experiences and processes emotions in a certain way, continuity in personal identity
    - **Aesthetic:** Has a certain kind of body and posture

### Impairment vs. Disability
- People without “normal” abilities experience impairment and disability; what’s the difference?
    - Impairment is the non-normal ability (Ex: impaired sight, hearing, mobility)
    - Disability is the socially created restriction or oppression experienced by the impaired person (Ex: not being able to take the metro or enter a store)

## Medical vs. Social Model
- **Medical model** = disability is located “in the apparently ‘damaged’ body or mind of an individual, inviting a personal narrative of ‘tragedy’ followed by ‘heroic’ efforts at self-adjustment” (Hansen and Philo)

- **Social model** = disability is located in “the wider society that fails to accommodate his or her impairment”; points to “the underlying ‘ableism’ of a non-disabled society that creates a world in its own able-bodied image” (Hansen and Philo)

## Ableism
- **Ableism** = the false idea that disabled people are by default inferior, when in truth disability is just another way for a mind/body to be; it is a form of discrimination

- Ableism is a system that places value on people's bodies and minds based on societally constructed ideas of normalcy, intelligence, excellence, and productivity
    - These constructed ideas are deeply rooted in anti-blackness, eugenics, colonialism, and capitalism

- This form of systemic oppression leads to people and society determining who is valuable and worthy based on a person's appearance and/or their ability to satisfactorily (re)produce, excel, and "behave"
    - You do not have to be disabled to experience ableism

- Ableism as a **system of power**
    - Like other norms, assumptions about “normal” abilities often go unnoticed by people who can embody them (non-disabled people)
    - "The non-disabled body is arbitrarily established as the ‘natural’ way of appearing, being, and doing" (Hansen and Philo)
    - Able bodies and able-bodied spaces are thus "’unmarked’ in much the same way that white people are commonly unmarked in mainstream Western localities" (Hansen and Philo)
