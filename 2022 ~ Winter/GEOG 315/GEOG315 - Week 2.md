# GEOG315 - Week 2: Geography's Implications I

# Reading Notes: Histories of Geographical Knowledge - Driver
- Reading concerned with a moment in the history of geographical knowledge, that being the **institutionalization of geography during the late nineteenth century**

- Masculine themes of heroism were tied to geography
    - Conrad's idea of the **geography militant**

- The relationship between geography and imperialism was seldom explored in the past, however this was done notably by **Hudson in his essay on "The new geography and the new imperialism" (1977)**
    - Hudson notes the close chronological correspondence between the birth of modern geography and the emergence of a new phase of capitalist imperialism during the 1870's
    - The relationship between geography and empire is defined clearly by Hudson:
        - Hudson argues that "new geography" was promoted largely to "serve the interests of imperialism in its various aspects including territorial acquisition, economic exploitation, militarism, and the practice of class and race domination"; geography as an aid to statecraft
        - Geographical knowledge was represented as a tool of empire, enabling both the acquisition of territory and the exploitation of resources
        - This was all enabled by geography as it lent ideological credibility of itself as a science to the ideologies of imperialism and racism (especially through discourses of **environmental determinism**)
