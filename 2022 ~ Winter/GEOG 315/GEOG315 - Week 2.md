# GEOG315 - Week 2: Geography's Implications I
- **Main topic of lecture and readings:** looking at how geography, as a tool and science, is implicated in colonialism/racism/slavery
    - Geography as a tool to gain domination/power over others

- What do this weeks readings have in common:
    - All of the readings look at how geography has been implicated in power relations, specifically the relation between European/white societies and various non-European/non-white societies
    - They all examine ideas about "race" and how ideas about geography often underwrite these ideas

- What do this readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - One focuses on European countries during the era of "Geography Militant" (late 1800's, early 1900's)
    - One focuses on white settlers in British Columbia from the late 1700's to the late 1800's
    - One focuses on professional geographers from Kant (around 1800) to the present
        - Race as a man-made construct that is used to categorize people and discriminate against them (historically)

# Lecture Notes: Geographies Implications I
- **Key Questions of this lecture:**
    1. What is the relationship between geography (in the sense of research by geographers) and the real world?
    2. What are some of the key geographical **ideas** that have shaped the world?
    3. What are some of the key geographical **tools or products** that have shaped the world?
        - Ex: Maps  

## Geography and the World
- What is then the relationship between geography and the real world?

- "Geography" refers both to the world and **writing/speaking about the world**
    - The way we write/speak about the world **shapes the world**, and is shaped by the world
    - The critical task is to think about how writing/speaking about the world relates to power

- Ones own perspective of a geography is **shaped by the things they've heard/seen/read**
    - This (uninformed) perspective then shapes how one **interacts with and experiences that geography**

- Felix Driver's position (first reading) comes from **Edward Said (author of Orientalism**:
    - "My position is that texts are worldly, to some degree they are events, and, even when they appear to deny it, they are nevertheless part of the social world, human life, and of course the historical moments in which they are located and interpreted" (page 30)
    - What we say about the world is not just a description of the world, it is a part of the world and interacts with it; texts are **events** with impact on the world around them

- Cole Harris (second reading):
    - "If the aim is to understand colonialism... then it would seem essential to investigate the sites where colonialism was actually practiced. Its effects were displayed there. The strategies and tactics on which it relied were actualized there." (page 166)
    - Hands-on approach of being physically present in the region where colonialism is taking place to get the best understanding of how exactly land is being taken

- Audrey Kobayashi (third reading):
    - "The concept of race as part of the dominant discourse in the world has been well understood by those most affected by its results" (page 1112)

## Geographical Ideas that have Shaped the World
- **Time of geography "militant" presented by Driver**
    - Late 1800's to early 1900's where European countries were scrambling to explore and dominate the remaining parts of the world
    - Ideas being brought back from this era of geography by researchers then shaped Europe's understanding of the rest of the world

- **Key ideas brought back:**
    - Division between **East (Orient)** and **West (Oxidant)** (Ex: far East, Middle East, near East); all relative to Europe/Euro-centric
        - Ideas associated with these divisions, the West being portrayed as civilized, rational, and advanced while the East is portrayed as irrational, uncivilized, depraved; **binary way of thinking where the values of each are defined in relation to each other**
    - Imagery of light and dark when describing Africa (Ex: "Darkest Africa", "Heart of Darkness"); area least explored/dominated by European reach

- Relevant to the **enlightenment period** in Europe
    - Period of rational thought and scientific progress in Europe
    - Shaped the way Europeans viewed the rest of the world, **i.e. un-enlightened**

# Reading Notes: Histories of Geographical Knowledge - Driver
- Reading concerned with a moment in the history of geographical knowledge, that being the **institutionalization of geography during the late nineteenth century**

- Masculine themes of heroism were tied to geography
    - Idea of the **geography militant**

- The relationship between geography and imperialism was seldom explored in the past, however this was done notably by **Hudson in his essay on "The new geography and the new imperialism" (1977)**
    - Hudson notes the close chronological correspondence between the birth of modern geography and the emergence of a new phase of capitalist imperialism during the 1870's
    - The relationship between geography and empire is defined clearly by Hudson:
        - Hudson argues that "new geography" was promoted largely to "serve the interests of imperialism in its various aspects including territorial acquisition, economic exploitation, militarism, and the practice of class and race domination"; geography as an aid to statecraft
        - Geographical knowledge was represented as a tool of empire, enabling both the acquisition of territory and the exploitation of resources
        - This was all enabled by geography as it lent ideological credibility of itself as a science to the ideologies of imperialism and racism (especially through discourses of **environmental determinism**)

# Reading Notes: How did Colonialism Dispossess? Comments from an Edge of Empire - Harris
- **Conclusions of the reading: (outlined in abstract)**
    - "The initial ability to dispossess rested primarily on physical power and the supporting infrastructure of the state"
    - "The momentum to dispossess derived from the interest of capital in profit and of settlers in forging new livelihoods"
    - "The legitimization of and moral justification for dispossession lay in cultural discourse that located civilization and savagery within a dichotomy and identified the land uses associated with each"
    - "The management of dispossession rested with a set of disciplinary technologies of which maps, numbers, law, and the geography of resettlement itself were the most important"

- Distinction between imperialism and colonialism
    - Imperialism is driven from the center
    - Colonialism is a set of activities/practices on the periphery of empire

- "The experienced materiality of colonialism is grounded in dispossession and repossessions of land"
    - Ex: Dispossession of land from British Columbia Natives causing them to be resettled in the reservation system; "Native people were in the way, their land wast coveted, and settlers took it"

## The Power to Dispossess
- Colonialism relied on disciplinary technology

## The Management of Dispossession

# Reading Notes: The Dialectic of Race and the Discipline of Geography - Kobayashi

# Video Notes: Racism, A History
- **Response Questions:**
    - What ideas about race do you see in the film?
        - Being a history of racism, ideas about race are obviously at the forefront
        - Secondary ideas related to race include the brutalization and dehumanization of other peoples (Ex: Spanish Conquistadors in the Americas)
        - Emergence of biological theories related to explaining differences in skin color, eventually leading to **racist theories** about differences in skin color
        - Association of black people with animals and apes, insinuating animalistic and savage nature
        - Capitalism being rooted in the exploitation of slave labor and conquered land for profit
        - Interpretations of religious ideas justifying racism, such as the "Curse of Ham" justifying the enslaving of others
        - "Slave" only became racialized when the Portuguese began enslaving West Africans
    - What ideas about geography (potentially tied to ideas about race)?
        - Example of Ancient Greeks using geographical ideas such as inclusion based on shared space/border to inform and justify ideas of superiority over others (non-Greeks); sense of belonging and exclusion to geographic space
    - What geographical tools or products do you see in the film (connected to the ideas)?
        - Colonial dependence on geographical tools of navigation and , such as maps, to even reach exploitable lands in the first place; tools such as maps are always implicated in the activities of geographically inclined colonizers
        - Geographic tools are directly implicated in the actions of colonizers as they facilitate the expression of imperial power upon weaker "savage" civilizations/peoples
