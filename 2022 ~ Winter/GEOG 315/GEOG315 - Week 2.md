# GEOG315 - Week 2: Geography's Implications I

# Lecture Notes: Geographies Implications I

# Reading Notes: Histories of Geographical Knowledge - Driver
- Reading concerned with a moment in the history of geographical knowledge, that being the **institutionalization of geography during the late nineteenth century**

- Masculine themes of heroism were tied to geography
    - Conrad's idea of the **geography militant**

- The relationship between geography and imperialism was seldom explored in the past, however this was done notably by **Hudson in his essay on "The new geography and the new imperialism" (1977)**
    - Hudson notes the close chronological correspondence between the birth of modern geography and the emergence of a new phase of capitalist imperialism during the 1870's
    - The relationship between geography and empire is defined clearly by Hudson:
        - Hudson argues that "new geography" was promoted largely to "serve the interests of imperialism in its various aspects including territorial acquisition, economic exploitation, militarism, and the practice of class and race domination"; geography as an aid to statecraft
        - Geographical knowledge was represented as a tool of empire, enabling both the acquisition of territory and the exploitation of resources
        - This was all enabled by geography as it lent ideological credibility of itself as a science to the ideologies of imperialism and racism (especially through discourses of **environmental determinism**)

# Reading Notes: How did Colonialism Dispossess? Comments from an Edge of Empire - Harris
- **Conclusions of the reading: (outlined in abstract)**
    - "The initial ability to dispossess rested primarily on physical power and the supporting infrastructure of the state"
    - "The momentum to dispossess derived from the interest of capital in profit and of settlers in forging new livelihoods"
    - "The legitimization of and moral justification for dispossession lay in cultural discourse that located civilization and savagery within a dichotomy and identified the land uses associated with each"
    - "The management of dispossession rested with a set of disciplinary technologies of which maps, numbers, law, and the geography of resettlement itself were the most important"

- Distinction between imperialism and colonialism
    - Imperialism is driven from the center
    - Colonialism is a set of activities/practices on the periphery of empire

- "The experienced materiality of colonialism is grounded in dispossession and repossessions of land"
    - Ex: Dispossession of land from British Columbia Natives causing them to be resettled in the reservation system; "Native people were in the way, their land wast coveted, and settlers took it"

## The Power to Dispossess
- Colonialism relied on disciplinary technology

## The Management of Dispossession
