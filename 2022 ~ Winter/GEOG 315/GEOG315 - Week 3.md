# GEOG315 - Week 3: Settler Colonialism
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all analyze settler colonialism in so-called Canada
    - They all contrast settler-colonial ideas and/or practices with Indigenous ideas and/or practices; multiple ways to view land and property

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Dorries focuses on a Maclean's article about Winnipeg, analyzing how it reproduces settler colonialism
    - Pasternak focuses on efforts to privatize indigenous reserves
    - Daigle focuses on Cree practices of self-determination and "resurgence"

# Lecture Notes: Geography of Settler Colonialism
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - What is settler colonialism?
        - What kind of relationship between the settler-colonial state and Indigenous people does it involve?
        - What kind of relationship with geography (Ex: the land) does it involve?
    - How does settler colonialism vary over time and/or across space?
    - How have Indigenous people resisted settler colonialism?

## What is Settler Colonialism?
- **Settler colonialism** =  form of colonialism that seeks to replace the original population of the colonized territory with a new society of settlers

- What do the readings say about settler colonialism?
    - The colonizing force **stays**; seeks to replace
    - It's not a past event, but a structure; a form of power that stretches across time
    - Involves a "logic of elimination" (can include genocide or other practices; Ex: residential schools)
    - Gendered; it has particular effects on Indigenous women
    - It's fundamentally about the **land and sovereignty**
        - Settler colonialism is about taking the land, keeping the land, and ensuring that there aren't other conflicting political or social claims upon the land
        - Sovereignty in the European sense requires **absolute control over the territory**, while "sovereign" Indigenous bands could co-exist in the same territory; the goal of settler colonialism is to continually reproduce European sovereignty and eliminate Indigenous sovereignty

## How does Settler Colonialism vary over Time and/or across Space?
- Some basic questions:
    - What countries are settler colonies?
        - Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico
    - What kinds of spaces exist within settler colonies?
        - Institutions (Ex: Residential schools, jails)
        - Reserves
        - Cities
    - When did settler colonialism start? When did it end?
        - Started with discovery of the new world (1492)
        - Has not ended
    - What kinds of logics have existed during different time periods?

## Pasternak - Privatization of Reserves
- The reserve as a **"political space"** (not just a physical terrain); a space where political powers are operating
    - Reserves are the product of settlers pushing Indigenous people onto small parcels of land
    - Reserves were also about **creating a space where Indigenous people could be controlled and remade into capitalist citizens**; Ex: "Kill the Indian in them"

- **Collective title vs. individual title**
    - Collective ownership: land is owned by a collective/band, and is then leased out to individuals; basis for Indigenous government
    - Individual ownership: anyone can own and profit off of land they own

- The First Nations Property Ownership Act
    - **Why are Indigenous resistant to privatization (individual title)?**
        - Many Indigenous people are very resistant to the privatization of reserve land (done by granting individual titles) as it only further assimilates Indigenous spaces into the colonial capitalist system/culture
    - **Who is pushing for the privatization of Indigenous land?**
        - Mostly right wing think-tanks, some elected officials, and corporations
        - Notably some Indigenous groups also support privatization more than others
    - **Why are these groups pushing for privatization?**
        - Idea that that private ownership of land can be used to alleviate Indigenous poverty
        - Owning land gives access to **credit**
    - **Who stands to gain from privatization**
        - Corporation who want access to land and resources; reserve is no long a barrier as they can buy individuals out
        - Settler colonial state (Canada); more tax revenue, shrinking sovereign Indigenous land
        - Some Indigenous who live close to cities stand to benefit massively from this (they now own/can sell/mortgage valuable land); what about the rest?
    - **Who stands to lose from privatization?**
        - Indigenous individuals on undesired/unacceptable land wont profit off of their new private land and be burdened by it
        - Indigenous communities lose as their collective title to the land (which provides the basis for collective government) becomes whittled away

- **Takeaways from reading:**
    - Settler colonialism can change over time, from forcing Indigenous people only reserves to trying to take their reserve land
    - And yet, there's still an enduring logic there, the logic of settler colonialism

## Dorries - Winnipeg
- Focus on **city**: how do certain discourses (ways of thinking about something) reproduce the city as a settler colonial space?
    - Indigenous space vs. urban space
    - Discussions of poverty, violence, damage; idea of the harms of **damage-centered research**
    - Discussions of white racism
    - Tina Fontaine, the pain of her aunt
    - White apologies; hollow words, land is never given back
        - Being guilty makes one a "good settler"
    - Indigenous resistance, flourishing

- The reading is reviewing how a **Maclean's article that meant to bring attention to racism in Winnipeg actually participated in settler colonialism**
    - The Maclean's article focused heavily on the damage done to the Indigenous community while failing to highlight the systems and actors that did this damage
    - This fixation on the damage done, reproduces settler colonialism ideas about Indigenous peoples rather than building them up or highlighting their resistance

## Daigle - Self-Determination
- Idea of Indigenous resistance through living an authentic Indigenous life
    - "Resurgence", or the practice of self-determination (maintaining Indigenous thinking and way of being through traditional practices) as a form of resistance

- State recognition vs. Indigenous self-determination
- Law of **Awawanenitakik**
    - Concerned with the nature of a community or nation, and the laws that govern relations
    - How to live these relations, be self-determining
    - Role of ceremony  

# Reading Notes: “Welcome to Winnipeg”; Making settler colonial urban space in “Canada’s most racist city” - Dorries
- This chapter is analyzing the response to a Maclean's article that was published labeling Winnipeg as “Canada’s most racist city” due to their treatment of indigenous peoples
    - The Maclean's article focused on Winnipeg's North End Neighborhood and the many social and economic problems that impact the well-being of Indigenous peoples
        - Problems include substance abuse, low graduation rates, high suicide rates, high hospitalization rates, police harassment, and lack of funding for social support systems

- Eve Tuck's critical analysis of **damage-centered research** (research that only focuses on hardships experienced by Indigenous communities)
    - She observes that studies of pain and loss are often mobilized in order to make political gains, generating damage-centered research that places hurt and loss at the forefront of analysis
    - Damage-centered research approaches make it difficult for communities to think of themselves as anything other than broken and stunts possibilities for community growth; they naturalize the effects of colonialism rather than effectively combating them

- This chapter analyzes how the Maclean's article uses **damage-centered research** to reinforce negative perceptions of Winnipeg's North End, and aids in the creation of settler colonial urban space by circulating a specific set of narratives about Indigenous people that naturalize Indigenous death and dispossession, and normalize the settler colonial logic of elimination

# Reading Notes: How Capitalism will save Colonialism; The Privatization of Reserve Lands in Canada - Pasternak
- Reading talks about attempts to privatize reserve land

# Reading Notes: Awawanenitakik; The spatial politics of recognition and relational geographies of Indigenous self-determination - Daigle
- Idea of **self-determination** for Indigenous peoples

- law of **awawanenitakik** = "importance of living an Omushkegowuk Cree way of life by actively upholding our responsibilities to our ancestral lands by engaging in place-based customs such as learning and speaking Omushkego, the Cree language, taking part in our annual ceremonies, and harvesting and sharing our local foods"

- "recognition-based strategies are founded on and materially reproduce colonial imaginaries of territory that continue to inflict violence on Indigenous legal and governance orders while facilitating the economic and political sovereignty of Canada"
