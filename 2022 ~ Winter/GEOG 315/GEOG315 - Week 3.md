# GEOG315 - Week 3: Settler Colonialism
- What do this weeks readings have in common:
    - They all analyze settler colonialism in so-called Canada
    - They all contrast settler-colonial ideas and/or practices with Indigenous ideas and/or practices; multiple ways to view land and property

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Dorries focuses on a Maclean's article about Winnipeg, analyzing how it reproduces settler colonialism
    - Pasternak focuses on efforts to privatize indigenous reserves
    - Daigle focuses on Cree practices of self-determination and "resurgence"

# Lecture Notes: Geography of Settler Colonialism
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - What is settler colonialism?
        - What kind of relationship between the settler-colonial state and Indigenous people does it involve?
        - What kind of relationship with geography (Ex: the land) does it involve?
    - How does settler colonialism vary over time and/or across space?
    - How have Indigenous people resisted settler colonialism?

## What is Settler Colonialism?
- **Settler colonialism** =  form of colonialism that seeks to replace the original population of the colonized territory with a new society of settlers

- What do the readings say about settler colonialism?
    - The colonizing force **stays**; seeks to replace
    - It's not a past event, but a structure; a form of power that stretches across time
    - Involves a "logic of elimination" (can include genocide or other practices; Ex: residential schools)
    - Gendered; it has particular effects on Indigenous women
    - It's fundamentally about the **land and sovereignty**
        - Settler colonialism is about taking the land, keeping the land, and ensuring that there aren't other conflicting political or social claims upon the land
        - Sovereignty in the European sense requires **absolute control over the territory**, while "sovereign" Indigenous bands could co-exist in the same territory; the goal of settler colonialism is to continually reproduce European sovereignty and eliminate Indigenous sovereignty

## How does Settler Colonialism vary over Time and/or across Space?
- Some basic questions:
    - What countries are settler colonies?
        - Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico
    - What kinds of spaces exist within settler colonies?
    - When did settler colonialism start? When did it end?
    - What kinds of logics have existed during different time periods?

# Reading Notes: “Welcome to Winnipeg”; Making settler colonial urban space in “Canada’s most racist city” - Dorries
- This chapter is analyzing the response to a Maclean's article that was published labeling Winnipeg as “Canada’s most racist city” due to their treatment of indigenous peoples
    - The Maclean's article focused on Winnipeg's North End Neighborhood and the many social and economic problems that impact the well-being of Indigenous peoples
        - Problems include substance abuse, low graduation rates, high suicide rates, high hospitalization rates, police harassment, and lack of funding for social support systems

- Eve Tuck's critical analysis of **damage-centered research** (research that focuses on hardships experienced by Indigenous communities)
    - She observes that studies of pain and loss are often mobilized in order to make political gains, generating damage-centered research that places hurt and loss at the forefront of analysis
    - Damage-centered research approaches make it difficult for communities to think of themselves as anything other than broken and stunts possibilities for community growth; they naturalize the effects of colonialism rather than effectively combating them

- This chapter analyzes how the Maclean's article uses **damage-centered research** to reinforce negative perceptions of Winnipeg's North End, and aids in the creation of settler colonial urban space by circulating a specific set of narratives about Indigenous people that naturalize Indigenous death and dispossession, and normalize the settler colonial logic of elimination

# Reading Notes: How Capitalism will save Colonialism; The Privatization of Reserve Lands in Canada - Pasternak
- Idea of **fee simple** ownership of Aboriginal property

# Reading Notes: Awawanenitakik; The spatial politics of recognition and relational geographies of Indigenous self-determination - Daigle
- Idea of **self-determination** for Indigenous peoples

- law of **awawanenitakik** = "importance of living an Omushkegowuk Cree way of life by actively upholding our responsibilities to our ancestral lands by engaging in place-based customs such as learning and speaking Omushkego, the Cree language, taking part in our annual ceremonies, and harvesting and sharing our local foods"

- "recognition-based strategies are founded on and materially reproduce colonial imaginaries of territory that continue to inflict violence on Indigenous legal and governance orders while facilitating the economic and political sovereignty of Canada"
