# GEOG315 - Week 4: Migration
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all analyze how states seek to manage migration through actions on people and spaces beyond their borders
    - They all analyze how these efforts either circumvent or simply ignore international law
    - To varying extents, they all link these efforts to colonial or neocolonial arrangements of power

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Dickson examines Australia, looking at various actions outside the state's borders (Ex: island detention, interdiction at sea)
    - Mountz and Loyd examine the United States, looking at the various reasons that the US began to detain and "interdict" migrants
    - Benoit examines France and the control of migration in its overseas territories

# Lecture Notes: Geographies of Migration
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - How do nation-states use "extra-territorial" actions to manage migration
    - What objectives, ideas, and practices enable and/or compel these actions? (i.e. why is this happening?)
    - In what ways are these actions an expression of colonial state power over "foreign" people and spaces

- Issues of migration are heavily related to colonial power relationships and racism
    - When talking about issues of migration, we are mostly talking about people migrating from the third world to the first world; from formerly colonized powers to colonized powers
    - Migration as a post-colonial/neo-colonial process

- Idea of "race" as a **fiction, but with real world effects**
    - We must recognize that races don't exist, they were made up to colonize and oppress the world; while "real" differences in humans exist (skin color, hair texture, etc.), these differences are just categories recognize physical differences that say nothing about the nature of the person
    - Despite being made-up, ideas of race have real-world impacts; these "fictional" ideas are used to organize the world, creating very different realities for different "races" of people

## Dickson - Australia
- How did Australia use "extra-territorial" actions to manage migration?
    - Sept 2001: defined a series of small islands as outside the **"migration zone"**
    - Late 2001: offshore detention in Nauru and Papua New Guinea
    - Acts in territorial waters of Indonesia, repatriating boats
    - Also in 2013, Australia removed itself from the migration zone, forcing migrants to be funneled through smaller islands where they can then be further limited from entering Australia

- What objectives, ideas, and practices enable and/or compel these actions?
    - Australian state wants to avoid the obligations of international refugee law
    - It's beyond scrutiny/the sight of critical eyes; It's hard for the UN or amnesty international to investigate what is happening to migrants on these islands
    - By making the immigration process so hard it is supposed to act as a "deterrent" to stop other migrants from wanting to enter Australia
    - **The result:** "disarticulated geographies of sovereign authority, spaces where the state exercises power, but where its systems of rights do not exists" (page 3)

## Mountz and Loyd - US
- What is the **"production of remoteness"** (key idea in article)

- How is US using "extra-territorial" actions to manage migration?
    - The creation of "buffer zones" off the coast of the US
    - Offshore detention (Guantanamo, Antigua, etc.)

- What objectives, ideas, and practices enable and/or compel these actions?
    - Objectives: searching for increase prisoner capacity, avoiding legal responsibility, respond to local lobbying efforts (in the case of domestic detention)
    - Ideas: race/racism
    - Practices: bilateral agreements with "host" countries
    - The authors note that these practices were an extension of **territorial detention** (which began in 1978 with Haitians and then everyone else)

## Benoit - France
- How is France using "extra-territorial" actions to manage migration?
    - Laws apply differently in France than in overseas territories (OSTs):
        - A visa to enter France may not apply in the OST, and vise-versa
        - Temp residency permits are issued for France OR OST (not both)
        - Refugees in OST can't appeal their case
        - Policy after Haitian earthquake is different in France vs. OST
        - In the OST, there are land zones and ID checks don't require a justification

- What objectives, ideas, and practices enable and/or compel these actions?
    - Objectives: keep poor people from coming to France; keep people poor/subjugated
    - Practices: creation of land zones (which "cover all areas where people can circulate"), roadblocks, high intensity policing in border towns, detention facilities

## How is this Colonialism?
- What can we learn from the readings?
    - Dickson: colonialism breaks with the "Westphalian lens" (as do migration controls); detention relies on racial distinctions between "us" and "them"
    - Mountz and Loyd: neo-colonial relationship with Haiti; migration controls as "the operationalization of colonial desires to segregate and contain"
    - Benoit: the OSts are colonies; a two-tiered system

- Colonialism is about one state/peoples control over foreign territories and people; this is what migration controls do
- Colonialism produced the idea of "races" (racial superiority and inferiority) tied to particular geographies. Migration controls rely on ideas about racial difference and distance. The same controls don't apply to citizens in the global North
- Colonialism is about controlling the geography of wealth, and confining the wealth of the world to certain geographies and peoples. In a world where capital and goods can move easily, controlling the movement of people ensures wealth remains confined to wealthy countries

# Reading Notes: Distancing Asylum Seekers from the State; Australia's Evolving Political Geography of Immigration and Border Control - Dickson
- **Article Topic:** Exploring Australia's exclusion of asylum seekers through geopolitical tactics such as mobility regulation, that ensure they do not have access to the state's systems of protection on conditions of exteriority

- **Offshore immigration detention**; idea of "detention archipelago"
    - Offshore detention as "sites of exaggerated biopolitical power, spaces where states segregate and control certain categories of mobile bodies, suspending human agency."

- Context of criminalization and securitization of migration in Australia; growing distinction between inside/outside, in which offshore detention suspends asylum seekers in a condition of exteriority

## Security & territory in Australia's Asylum Policy
- While the space/territory of state is usually fixed to its cartographic boundary, **sovereign power is NOT restricted to the boundary of the state as mapped**
    - Dis-articulated geographies of sovereign authority, spaces where the state executes power, but where its systems of rights do not exist; Disconnect between spatiality of policing and that of law and justice

- "The securitization of migration reflects the objective of the sovereign state to order and regulate the population"

- UN Refugee Convention principle of **"non-refoulement"**; cannot send refugees back where their safety is compromised
    - Despite the non-refoulement principle, states increasingly engage in geographical process such as **deflection and deterrence**, which negate the state's obligation to the Convention by returning asylum seekers to transit or neighboring countries "before they reach sovereign territory"

- Offshore detention facilities thus **undermine the Refugee Convention by reducing the legal spaces where asylum is valid**; Mountz refers to this strategy as the construction of an "archipelago of exclusion"
    - Geographical practice of "bordering", where spaces of rights are increasingly restricted, while policing and exclusion are spatially expanded

- The impact of 9/11 gave unprecedented momentum to the doctrine of securitization, encouraging all social, economic and political concerns of the state to be ‘reconfigured and interpreted through the prism of security’
    - Following 2001, Australia's migration policies were re-conceptualized through the implementation of the "Pacific Solution" (process of offshoring Australia's immigration detention

- Australia reformed its Migration Act to excise outlying territories from Australia's "migration zone" (territories in which one could apply for asylum), thus restricting the space in which one could legally be deemed a refugee; circumvents the obligations of the Refugee Convention by contracting the state's zone of protection
    - The reformation of the Migration Act also stipulated that anyone in an excised territory was "an unlawful non-citizen" and subject to removed to a "declared country"; this allows the removal of asylum seekers from the state for the purpose of offshore detention
    - Australia then signed memorandums of understanding with Papua New Guinea and Nauru, permitting Australia to offshore its immigration detention to neighboring island

- Idea of the **"state of exception"**

## Islands
- Processing of asylum seekers on offshore islands is premised upon a technology of distance, which not only removes asylum seekers from the territory of the state but also relies on ambiguous geographies of responsibility and operational invisibility

- Australia's practice of offshore detention can be seen as a **colonial** practice as it reinvigorates colonial structure within the region; relationships of inequitable power allow Australian influence and control in extraterritorial geographies, and the spaces of neighboring islands become defined by Australia's domestic policies of immigration detention

- Who has jurisdictional authority in offshore detention?
    - Australia has the authority in offshore detention centers as the "transferring state", however PNG and Nauru are also responsible as well as they are both signatories of the Refugee Convention; overlapping grey area of responsibility where no party is solely responsible 

## Oceans
- "Operation Sovereign Borders" was effective in its primary objective of "stopping the boats", however there is concern as to whether this disregards the rule of "non-refoulement" As Australia is turning away refugees

- Oceans as spaces away from eyes; inaccessible and invisible geographies where human rights crimes can occur

## Conclusion
- This article examined how the Australian state is using ad hoc changes to domestic law to allow for the **offshore detention of asylum seekers** while simultaneously shrinking the area in which one can legally apply for asylum, thus avoiding their UN responsibly to host and guard asylum seekers 

- Australia's asylum policy is premised on preemptive strategies that increasingly keep asylum seekers at a distance from the state

- Offshore detention of asylum seekers and heightened maritime policing are the key strategies being used by Australia

# Reading Notes: Fortress Europe's Far-Flung Borderlands; "Illegality" and the "Deportation Regime" in France's Caribbean and Indian Ocean Territories - Benoit
- Fortress Europe

- "Laws of exception"

# Reading Notes: Transnational Productions of Remoteness; Building Onshore and Offshore Carceral Regimes Across Borders - Mountz & Loyd

## Conclusions
- The US strategy is relying on the **threat of detention** as a deterrent clashed with its **capacity to detain**
