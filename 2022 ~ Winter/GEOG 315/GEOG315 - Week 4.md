# GEOG315 - Week 4: Migration

# Lecture Notes: Geographies of Migration
- Issues of migration are heavily related to colonial power relationships and racism
    - When talking about issues of migration, we are mostly talking about people migrating from the third world to the first world; from formerly colonized powers to colonized powers
    - Migration as a post-colonial/neo-colonial process

- Idea of "race" as a fiction, but with real world effects
    - We must recognize that races don't exist, they were made up to colonize and oppress the world; while "real" differences in humans exist (skin color, hair texture, etc.), these differences are just categories recognize physical differences that say nothing about the nature of the person
    - Despite being made-up, ideas of race have real-world impacts; these "fictional" ideas are used to organize the world, creating very different realities for different "races" of people

# Reading Notes: Distancing Asylum Seekers from the State; Australia's Evolving Political Geography of Immigration and Border Control - Dickson
- **Article Topic:** Exploring Australia's exclusion of asylum seekers through geopolitical tactics such as mobility regulation, that ensure they do not have access to the state's systems of protection on conditions of exteriority

- **Offshore immigration detention**; idea of "detention archipelago"
    - Offshore detention as "sites of exaggerated biopolitical power, spaces where states segregate and control certain categories of mobile bodies, suspending human agency

- Context of criminalization and securitization of migration in Australia; growing distinction between inside/outside, in which offshore detention suspends asylum seekers in a condition of exteriority

## Security & territory in Australia's Asylum Policy
- While the space/territory of state is usually fixed to its cartographic boundary, **sovereign power is NOT restricted to the boundary of the state as mapped**
    - Dis-articulated geographies of sovereign authority, spaces where the state executes power, but where its systems of rights do not exist; Disconnect between spatiality of policing and that of law and justice

- "The securitization of migration reflects the objective of the sovereign state to order and regulate the population"

- UN Refugee Convention principle of **"non-refoulement"**; cannot send refugees back where their safety is compromised
    - Despite the non-refoulement principle, states increasingly engage in geographical process such as **deflection and deterrence**, which negate the state's obligation to the Convention by returning asylum seekers to transit or neighboring countries "before they reach sovereign territory"

- Offshore detention facilities thus **undermine the Refugee Convention by reducing the legal spaces where asylum is valid**; Mountz refers to this strategy as the construction of an "archipelago of exclusion"
    - Geographical practice of "bordering", where spaces of rights are increasingly restricted, while policing and exclusion are spatially expanded

- The impact of 9/11 gave unprecedented momentum to the doctrine of securitization, encouraging all social, economic and political concerns of the state to be ‘reconfigured and interpreted through the prism of security’
    - Following 2001, Australia's migration policies were re-conceptualized through the implementation of the "Pacific Solution" (process of offshoring Australia's immigration detention

- Australia reformed its Migration Act to excise outlying territories from Australia's "migration zone" (territories in which one could apply for asylum), thus restricting the space in which one could legally be deemed a refugee; circumvents the obligations of the Refugee Convention by contracting the state's zone of protection
    - The reformation of the Migration Act also stipulated that anyone in an excised territory was "an unlawful non-citizen" and subject to removed to a "declared country"; this allows the removal of asylum seekers from the state for the purpose of offshore detention
    - Australia then signed memorandums of understanding with Papua New Guinea and Nauru, permitting Australia to offshore its immigration detention to neighboring island

- Idea of the **"state of exception"**

## Islands
- Processing of asylum seekers on offshore islands is premised upon a technology of distance, which not only removes asylum seekers from the territory of the state but also relies on ambiguous geographies of responsibility and operational invisibility

- Australia's practice of offshore detention can be seen as a **colonial** practice as it reinvigorates colonial structure within the region; relationships of inequitable power allow Australian influence and control in extraterritorial geographies, and the spaces of neighboring islands become defined by Australia's domestic policies of immigration detention

- Who has jurisdictional authority in offshore detention?
    - Australia has the authority in offshore detention centers as the "transferring state", however PNG and Nauru are also responsible as well as they are both signatories of the Refugee Convention; overlapping grey area of responsibility where no party is solely responsible 

## Oceans
- "Operation Sovereign Borders" was effective in its primary objective of "stopping the boats", however there is concern as to whether this disregards the rule of "non-refoulement" As Australia is turning away refugees

- Oceans as spaces away from eyes; inaccessible and invisible geographies where human rights crimes can occur

## Conclusion
- This article examined how the Australian state is using ad hoc changes to domestic law to allow for the **offshore detention of asylum seekers** while simultaneously shrinking the area in which one can legally apply for asylum, thus avoiding their UN responsibly to host and guard asylum seekers 

- Australia's asylum policy is premised on preemptive strategies that increasingly keep asylum seekers at a distance from the state

- Offshore detention of asylum seekers and heightened maritime policing are the key strategies being used by Australia

- Fortress Europe

- "Laws of exception"

# Reading Notes: Transnational Productions of Remoteness; Building Onshore and Offshore Carceral Regimes Across Borders - Mountz & Loyd

## Conclusions
- The US strategy of relying on the **threat of detention** as a deterent clashed with its **capacity to detain**
