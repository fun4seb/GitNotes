# GEOG315 - Week 5: Whiteness
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all analyze whiteness, and how it is "produced" through ideas and practices; how is "whiteness" made?

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Shaw examines how white people in a gentrifying part of Sydney talk about "The Block", an indigenous part of the area
    - Vanderbeck examines how people involved with the Fresh Air fund talk about Vermont and “inner city” New York
    - Slocum examines white ideas and practices in the alternative food movement in Minnesota

# Lecture Notes: Geographies Whiteness
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - What is whiteness?
        - Socially constructed category situated at the top of a racial hierarchy
        - Race/whiteness as a fiction with real world effects
    - How is whiteness “produced”? What ideas about people does it entail? What ideas about space? What practices?
        - Continuously remade everyday through ideas and practices that perpetuate ideas that place whiteness at the top of the social/racial hierarchy
    - What are the consequences of whiteness? Are they always oppressive?
        - Whiteness produces inequality/oppression; without "whiteness" you cant have white supremacy or a racial hierarchy with white at the top
        - It can be useful to identify as white to take responsibility for your privileges in order to address inequalities that segregate and oppress in order to make a better world; must first recognize that there is a problem (that we are apart of) in order to make change

- Talking of the making of the category "white"; how is this category of "whiteness" reproduced culturally?

## What is Whiteness?
- **Vanderbeck:** whiteness “refers to the privileges of being a member of a socially unmarked class and the assumed norm – socially, physically, and even politically – that dominates national ideas about beauty, social class, and goodness (morality)” (1136)
    - Privilege = unearned advantages
    - There is an unmarked category (white), defined as the norm, that shapes the way we think about beauty, class, and morality

- **Slocum:** “I use the term ‘whiteness’ to refer to bodies with pale skin color, the changing tendencies of those bodies to do certain things in a particular context, and the socio-spatial processes with which those tendencies are linked” (2)
    - What's different about this definition is that it incorporates skin color; whiteness is attributed to certain kinds of bodies
    - People who look a certain way (pale), do certain things, and that is part of a process that remakes the world in a particular way

- Whiteness is a racial category within a racial hierarchy; it sits **atop** that hierarchy

- Whiteness is flexible over time and across space – its boundaries (who’s included, who’s excluded) can be drawn differently in different times and spaces
    - Ex: Irish people weren't considered "white" in the 1800's

- Whiteness refers to phenotype, but also a set of characteristics assumed to be associated with the phenotype
    - **Phenotype** = body type; way of describing bodily characteristics (hair texture, skin color, eye shape, etc.)
    - It is not that people are just placed in categories by phenotype, it is that the phenotype is supposed to say/determine something about the person (i.e. how "moral" or intelligent one is)

- Whiteness, like any racial category, requires continual action to persist; it needs to be continually reproduced through... whatever produces it!

## What's Complicated about Whiteness?
- Whiteness is an **"unmarked" category**
    - It is seldom talked about directly, but gains its definition primarily through (a) the ways other racial groups are talked about, and (b) assumed “norms” of human life (that are actually particular to white people)

- The function of whiteness is **oppression**, and yet combating oppression requires white people to recognize themselves as white... in a racial hierarchy
    - "Whiteness" serves the purpose of maintaining a social hierarchy

## Shaw - Sydney
- **How is whiteness reproduced?** What ideas about people does it entail? What ideas about space? What practices?
- What are the consequences of whiteness? Are they always oppressive?

- **Shaw:** looking at the "bloc" (indigenous area in Sydney) and how white people, property developers, and politicians in the area talk and relate to the bloc
    - What do people say about the bloc that maintains the racial hierarchy?
        - People refer to it as "Sydney's Harlem", signifying "black", poverty, crime
        - People talk about the upkeep of the area, characterizing it as "dirty", which is implying something about the people who live there
        - People say that the bloc "failed", implying that the people failed to prosper rather than the fact that settler colonialism continued to exist; responsibility for the "failure" of the bloc attributed to indigenous
    - Idea of "reverse racism", (wrongfully) suggesting that society is unequally supporting minorities rather than white people; Ex: people think the government is giving too much to the indigenous people, that people are too critical of the police
    - Idea of the unmarked category of whiteness; people are talking about indigenous people while at the same time (without having to say it) are making implications about white people as the moral center from which minority groups deviate from
        - Ex: By saying certain areas are "dirty", you are also saying that white areas are clean

## Vanderbeck - Vermont-NYC
- **How is whiteness reproduced?** What ideas about people does it entail? What ideas about space? What practices?
- What are the consequences of whiteness? Are they always oppressive?

- **Vanderbeck:** talking about the "fresh air fund" program that takes children from poor communities in NYC and has them stay with a family outside their area, in this case he is looking at Vermont
    - Geographies of "inner-city" and "suburbia" and the connotations that come with each; more than just location, there is meaning in location that constructed certain spaces with heavy racial overtones
        - Inner-city is associated with blackness/minorities, crime, poverty; construction of the inner-city as a problem space
        - Vermont is associated with whiteness, cleanliness, prosperity
    - "Discussions of the program construct an economy of defects and lacks, Vermont is constructed as the positive position within this binary opposition"
    - Idea about how the social environment of Vermont will benefit inner-city kids as people; one journalist says the benefit of the program is to give the kids a "normal family life"
        - Constructing "white" lifestyles as the norm that others should strive to achieve
        - By implying Vermont (white) represents the "normal family lifestyle", you are implying something about the lifestyle of those in the inner-city
    - Regardless of the ways the program benefits people, it participates in the reconstruction of the idea that an incredibly white environment is beneficial to the kids who come from racialized environments; reproducing whiteness as the top of the racial hierarchy

## Slocum - Minnesota

- **Slocum:** looking at how whiteness is reproduced in the alternative food movement in Minnesota
    - Examining the ways in which the food movement is exclusionary, through things such as expensive "healthy" food, and ideas surrounding "healthiness" that inform value judgments about the bodies of others (Ex: thin = healthy, fat = unhealthy)
