# GEOG315 - Week 6: Geographies Implications II
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all provide a critique of geographers understand capitalism (or the capitalist city)
    - They all suggest way of studying/understanding capitalism (or the capitalist city)

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Harvey critiques the entire history of geography (up to that point) and provides a different alternative, that being a **historical materialist (Marxist) geography**
        - Wants to create a form of geography that rather than accepting capitalism as natural, will dissect it to understand how capitalism works
    - Deutsche critiques Harvey for **ignoring gender** and modelling a kind of knowledge making (epistemology) in which gender has to disappear, and instead argues for a geography that pays attention to capitalism AND gender
        - While Harvey is going after those who naturalize capitalism (not looking at how it's made and the consequences of capitalism), Deutsche is going after Harvey for naturalizing the erasure of gender in the equation
    - Roy is critiquing Harvey's students for **ignoring the global South** and argues for a geography that examines how capitalism is imperialist (feeding off the global south)

# Lecture Notes: Geographies Implications II
- Talking about how geography/geographers have been implicated in the making of capitalism and a capitalist world
    - Just like how geography played a crucial role in colonial practices of dominating far-away places, geography also plays a crucial role in the making of the world into a **capitalist geography**

- **Key question of this lecture:**
    - How is geography implicated in capitalism?
        - Geography participated in mapping/managing the world in order to produce profit, and is implicated in "naturalizing" capitalism and inequalities (Harvey)
        - If you just understand capitalism as a class relation and never think about gender, you are marginalizing feminist anti-capitalist perspectives

## Geography and Capitalism
- How has geography been implicated in capitalism?; **cant answer this question before we understand what capitalism is**
- What is capitalism?; **cant answer this question before we learn what an economy is**

### The Meaning of "Economy"
- What is an economy then?
    - An "economy" is a system of organizing "things", work, and the results of work
    - We can think of an economy at various scales, from the household to the glove
    - There are an infinite number of possible systems to organize an economy, capitalism is just one of those systems

### The Meaning of "Capitalism"
- What is capitalism then?
    - Capitalism is an economic system defined by four characteristics:
        1. **Private property** (Ex: land, "natural resources", the "means of production")
        2. **Profit motive** (things and people are put into motion only if something thinks a profit can be made)
        3. **Artificial scarcity** (there aren't enough of everything to meet everyone's needs, but this isn't because of a physical shortage)
        4. **Class conflict** (people with money to invest and people with no money to invest form different classes, their interests are usually in conflict); Bourgeois vs. proletariat

- Whats key to geography (and Harvey's approach), is looking at how these things shape the world; the constant making of space is a process of class conflict under capitalism

## David Harvey: Naturalization of Capitalism
- How is geography (work by geographers) implicated in capitalism?; How does geography naturalize capitalism?

- Harvey mentions SIX aspects of "bourgeois" (capitalist) geography, THREE of them are:
    1. Mapping and surveys
        - In order to have private property (which capitalism requires), we need to know how the world is divided and who owns what
    2. Physical geography
        - In understanding the physical world and its resources, physical geography also makes it clear where the useful things of value are located in order to be controlled (Ex: valuable minerals)
    3. Management and planning

### Harvey vs. Positivism
- Whats wrong with positivism?
    - Can't grasp systemic relations (like capitalism) because they exceed sensory experience
    - As a result:
        - Positivism "naturalizes" capitalism
        - Positivism ignores all the questions that matter for social and ecological justice

### What's the Alternative?
- Geography will be concerned with social and ecological issues (it will not be neutral)
- It will develop theory (ways of understanding systems/relationships that aren't visible)
- It will focus on the geographical aspects of theory/systems
- It will provide one common language; it will "integrate general sensitivities into general social theories emanating from the historical materialist (Marxist) tradition"

## Rosalyn Deutsche: Gendered Imbalance of Capitalism
- How is geography (work by geographers) implicated in capitalism? 
    - Harvey's work seems complicit in the capitalist exploitation of non-men/non-white workers; if these groups are not included in his understanding of capitalism how can one fight on their side to correct specifically gendered imbalances in capitalism

- She begins with a criticism of Harvey:
    - His work doesn't analyze gender
    - His work adopts a form of knowledge making in which feminist research/activism are excluded
        - His way of understanding the world according to class conflict does not see women as women, but as workers, disregarding relevant social/gender issues that affect the organization of people
        - By saying all people are united under the worker class, Harvey is ignoring the ways in which women have radically different experiences within a capitalist society

- Harvey's form of knowledge making "seeks to unify all cultural mutations by locating their origin in a single foundation" (workers)
    - This makes feminist movements appear as "particularities" (not encompassing the whole picture)
        - He cant recognize how feminist movements can be anti-capitalist
    - This makes feminist theory appear particular (i.e. only concerned with gender)
        - He cant recognize how feminist (especially women of color feminists) have developed "intersectional" analyses
    - Essentially he is unifying all struggles under the struggle of "workers" (which are imagined as white male workers) and disregards the different experiences of gendered and racialized groups

## Ananya Roy: Understanding Capitalism from the Global South Perspective
- How is geography (work by geographers) implicated in capitalism? 
    - The work of Scott and Storper makes it hard to understand capitalism in the Global South, which is a kind of complicity in the continuation of capitalism in the Global South

- She begins with a criticism of Scott and Storper (two of Harvey's students)
    - Notes the two authors seek to fit all urban conditions into a "general concept of the urban". They critique the "new particularism"
    - But this makes it hard to develop new categories, methods, and theories in Global South cities; ideas that wouldn't be "universal", but could be generalized
    - She is essentially saying Scott and Storper are using a model developed in the First World to understand the Third World

- According to Roy we must understand Global South cities from within them, not the outside, as to examine them from a Global North perspective fails to see the general differences present in the Third world; "universal" theories (such as those proposed by Scott and Storper) prevent us from understanding the differences of Global South cities as unique spaces
