# GEOG315 - Week 7: Exploitation
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all examine how capital’s search for profit (through the exploitation of labour) relates to geography
    - They all analyze the capital/labour relation, while also bringing some attention to the role of gender within this

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Massey focuses on the “regional problem,” showing how local and international political-economic relations shaped the nature of the problem
    - Wright examines the organization of production at a maquiladora, showing how capital’s quest for value works through assumptions about gender and nationality and various spatial strategies at the workplace level
    - McDowell and Court examine how jobs are gendered, looking at how peoples’ behaviours express different gender norms and script certain jobs as more male or more female

# Lecture Notes: Labor & Exploitation
- **Key question of this lecture:**
    - What does it mean for capital to “exploit” labour?
    - How is the exploitation of labor related to geography?
        - How does exploitation shape geography?
        - How does geography shape exploitation?
    - How do other systems of power (Ex: gender) shape this two-way, socio-spatial process?

## Labor Exploitation: What does it mean for Capital to "Exploit" Labor
- Melissa Wright:
    - Labour (in its great diversity) is evaluated by capital in terms of a single, common “thing”; **“value”**
    - Capital “accumulation” (profit) depends on **paying workers less than the value of their labour**

- Other systems of power (Ex: gender, race) necessarily enter into this process
    - Capital may be able to pay certain groups **even less** for the value of their labor (Ex: women, minorities)
    - However: certain groups, by virtue of their social characteristics, may add **more “value”** to the product (especially in the case of services)

- Geography, too, is necessarily a part of this process
    - Capital may move from one location to another in order to better exploit labour (it is also, in this case, exploiting geographical differentiation)
    - Capital’s movements also create geographical differentiation, including differences in exploitable labour
    - And geography, like labour, is also shaped by socio-cultural meanings, so ideas about space (a country, a region, or even an area in a factory) shape capital accumulation

## Doreen Massey: "The Regional Problem"
- How is the exploitation of labor related to geography?
    - “Regional policy” in Britain since the 1960s was meant to deal with regional underdevelopment (poverty)
    - Policy created incentives for capital investment in service work, which was **gendered as female; thus low-wage**
    - But it was low-wage for a reason: the existing labour geography involved men working long hours, women doing unpaid domestic work. When men lose their jobs, women have to work (and they’re green; no labour organizing experience)

## Melissa Wright: Value, Gender, and Nationality
- How is the exploitation of labour related to geography? How is it related to other systems of power?
    - Obviously, there are geographical and **gendered reasons** for operating a maquiladora! (women workers in Mexico)
    - But this misses the question, it’s not “why are they paid so little, but why does cheap labour take a female Mexican form?”
    - Americans maintain control over the labour process. They are the bosses, even if Mexicans have the same rank (this is geographical in a continental sense)
    - Within the plant, management is located in one area, while labour is elsewhere (geography at the plant scale)

- How do other systems of power (Ex: gender) shape this two-way, socio-spatial process?
    - Tool work is male; making gauges (electronics) is women’s work
    - How to keep women workers from impacting the brand image? Uniforms, space, etc.
    - This is an ongoing struggle: if you don’t train the women workers, they leave (affecting profits), but if you treat them well their work becomes “Mexican”

- **There’s a contradiction:** need the low-wage labour, but need to preserve an American male image; The geography of the plant is manipulated to this end

## McDowell and Court: Gender and Banking
- How is the exploitation of labour related to geography?
    - There isn’t much on this in the article! But did you spot anything?
    - “The City” is the favored location for the new financial services industries (like Wall Street in the US); This is expensive real estate, but there are reasons it’s worth the expense

- How do other systems of power (Ex: gender) shape this two-way, socio-spatial process?
    - The rise of the finance sector in “The City” remake the gender of certain jobs
    - **Selling insurance was gendered female** (it’s about pleasing the customer)
    - **Selling stock is remade as male**  (now it’s about a contest of will, determination, persistence)
    - The whole finance sector comes to be described in gendered terms; it’s about determination, conquest (often imagined in sexual terms)
    - But there are different masculinities too; the trader (“iron balls”) vs. corporate finance (staid, sophisticated).

# Reading Notes: Spatial Divisions of Labor in Britain - Massey
- Process of production

- **Spatial divisions of labor approach** = seeks to understand the role of space and spatial differentiation in the evolution of the production process and its social relations

- Central to the approach is the notion of **waves/rounds of investment and disinvestment in the economic landscape**
    - Waves of investment are attracted to locations offering adequate opportunities for profitable production
    - Waves of disinvestment happen in locations where opportunity for profitable production has been exhausted

## Spatial Divisions of Labor: Some Underlying Principles
- Six underlying principles:
    1. a
    2. a
    3. a
    4. a
    5. a
    6. a

## From Industrialization to Decline
- Industrial revolution and sectoral spatial concentration

- The depression and uneven development

- Post-war rounds of investment

## The Last Twenty Years
- Decline and decentralization
    - Major change was the dramatic decline in jobs for men in the old industrial peripheral regions (Ex: coal mining)
        - Related to Wilson's strategy of "modernization"; updating of old, basic sectors of the economy
        - Resulted in massive loss of relatively well-paying jobs for men

- Changing forms of inequality
    - Association of service jobs with women and thus provide lower wages
    - Women as "green" workers (new to the workforce)
