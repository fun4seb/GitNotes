# GEOG315 - Week 8: Urban Development
- What do today’s readings have in common:
    - They all seek to understand urban development and the processes (mostly capitalism) that shape it.

- What distinguishes today’s readings; What do they NOT have in common:
    - Smith provides a general theory of urban development, linking it to a broader process of **“uneven development”**
        - Develops the idea of the **rent-gap** (very important concept)
    - Cowen and Lewis build on Smith’s work, while emphasizing how racism is integral to urban development (especially in Black communities)
    - Simone (first name) examines urban development in African cities, showing how conventional (First World) urban theories don’t properly explain what’s happening there

# Lecture Notes: Urban Development
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - How does capitalism shape urban development?
        - What is the logic of capitalism and how does that shape what does or doesn't get developed
    - How does gentrification fit into broader processes of capital accumulation at the urban and/or broader scales?
    - How does capitalism intersect with other systems of power, such as racism and (post)colonialism?

## Capitalism and the City
- **Core aspects of capitalism (and labor):**
    - Under capitalism, labor around the world is evaluated in terms of "value"
        - All different forms of labor can be differentiated according to the particular "value" they have under capitalism (Ex: dog walker vs. hedge fund manager); "value" = the ability to produce profit
    - Under capitalism, labor will be used to the extent that the labor can produce profit
        - Once utilizing someones labor no longer produces a profit, their labor will stop being utilized, because it is not economical feasible for capital accumulation (you lose money by utilizing their labor)
    - Capital accumulation (making capital/profit) depends on **paying people less than the value of their labor**
        - If you payed people equal or more than the value of their labor, you are no longer producing a profit and it is not feasible to utilize their labor in the first place
        - Paying people less than the value of their labor = **exploitation**

### Labor Exploitation
- **Labour exploitation and the city**; what does this help us understand?
    - One's economic class (Ex: laborer vs. asset owner) impacts where they can live; laborers need to live close to factories, those with enough means to access transportation can live farther away (Ex: in suburbs)
    - Smith: **“tendency toward equalization”**; the whole world is brought into a single system; There is some kind of global process where labor is being drawn into a single system (capitalism) and being evaluated in terms of a common metric, **value**
        - **Equalization** = everything being made "equal" in the sense it is all evaluated by the same thing, value
    - Equalization (creation of valued labor) propels urbanization
        - The development of capitalism produces industrialization and the mechanization of agriculture, therefor leading to urbanization; **It is this process that propels equalization and in turn urbanization**
            - As industrialization cements the urban environment as the center of labor (creation of factories), while simultaneously the mechanization of agriculture becomes more efficient and removes that livelihood from the common person as a means of survival, people are forced to aggregate where the new jobs exist (in cities) to sustain themselves (earn a wage), leading to a process of urbanization

### Value of Land (Ground Rent)
- **Value of land**; understanding labour isn’t enough, we need to understand other aspects of capitalism
    - Smith's idea of **“ground rent”** = the economic term for the cost of land in a system of private property; literally the value of the ground/land
        - Process of attributing **value** to the land (same as with labor)
    - The search for ground rent can lead to **equalization** (evaluating land according to the same thing, value)
        - Process of finding more and more land and attributing value to it as capitalism grows spatially; this leads to the creation of suburbs (urban sprawl as agricultural land become suburbanized)
    - This is then contrasted by a tendency toward **differentiation** (the opposite of equalization); equalization vs. differentiation
        - If equalization means to evaluate land on an equal basis (value), differentiation is the process of evaluating land on an **unequal basis**; Ex: class and race segregation
        - The value attributed to land can be influenced by **unequal socially created factors** such as class/race/zoning, NOT value

- An identical house in two different areas (meaning on different pieces of land) is **worth the same**, however will **sell at different prices according to the ground rent**

### The City Over Time
- What happens to cities over time?
    - Smith: tension between **valorization and devalorization**; basically, once we build something we don’t want to build something else there, but the things we build degrade over time if we don’t maintain them
        - This produces what Smith calls a **"rent-gap"**; the "gap" refers to the difference between what the land is currently worth, and the capital that the land could be producing if it were improved upon
    - Smith's idea of the **rent-gap** = the difference ("gap") between a property's current profit/value, and its potential for profit (if it were to be redeveloped)
        - The older a property is, the less income it produces thus widening the rent-gap between what it is currently making and what it could be making with the most profitable use of the land; **older property = wide rent-gap**
        - Eventually the rent-gap gets big enough that it makes more sense to stop investing in an old piece of land through maintenance, and to just demolish it and build something more profitable (see chart below)

- What about timing?
    - Smith: crisis and restructuring
    - Money is always being invested in property, but it **floods into property in moments of crisis and economic uncertainty**; the building of the suburbs was one response to crisis, gentrification is another
    - Gentrification is part of a broader post-1973 restructuring

## The Racial State
- What do Cowen and Lewis add to the analysis?
    - They are trying to think about urban development in the era of Black Lives Matter
    - The urban process is being shaped by capital, but there is also a **state/government** that has particular objectives and logics that might be different than the impersonal logical of capital
        - One of these objectives is a racial compulsion to control/evaluate people on the basis of race; this is clear when looking at **urban planning and policing**

- How does **policing** (which is inherently racist) shape the urban process?
    - Cannot talk about gentrification without the police; "the police make space livable"
        - The police are remaking the image of these spaces (through increased police presence that disproportional affect poor and racialized peoples; Ex: "broken-window policing") so that they can be reinvested in

## Urban Development in Africa
- What does Simone add to the analysis?
    - African cities entered capitalism not only later, but in a subordinate position as part of the global periphery
        - Their urban process tended to be controlled by business and property developers located elsewhere
        - This means that the urban processes influencing the development of African cities is inherently different than those elsewhere
    - While traditionally in capitalist there was a one-way migration from the rural to the urban, Simone finds that in African cities there is more of a cycle in which people have a home in both rural and urban settings and move back and forth between them
        - This is primarily due to much lower job security; jobs in the city often don't last forever so people move to the city when there is work, and move back to their rural homelands when there is none
        - This means that urbanization in the global North create much more (permanent) opportunities than those in the global South; those in African countries cannot benefit the same way and as those in Western countries
    - Simone often found that in African cities, land ownership is not clear (overlapping and ambiguous); this has implications on the ability to privatize land and profit off of it
