# GEOG315 - Week 9: Social Reproduction
- What do these readings have in common:
    - They all examine changes in social reproduction
    - They all examine how these changes are related to changes in production (capital accumulation through productive labour)
    - They all examine the geography of social reproduction and how this changes over time

- What do these readings NOT have in common; what distinguishes them:
    - Katz examines shifts in reproduction in the lives on children, primarily in Harlem and Sudan
    - England examines shifts in reproduction in the realms of health care in home childcare in Ontario
    - Mullings examines shifts in reproduction in Jamaica, including a shift from state provision to provision through migration and “gang welfare”

# Lecture Notes: Social Reproduction
- **Key questions of this lecture:**
    - What is social reproduction?
    - What is the relationship between social reproduction and production (under capitalism)?
    - How is social reproduction related to geography?

## What is Social Reproduction?
- What is social reproduction?; what does it entail?
    - “The fleshy, messy, and indeterminate stuff of everyday life”
    - “A structured set of practices”
    - Biological reproduction, keeping people alive and educated
    - Katz’s framework: political-economic, cultural, and environmental

- Relation to gender
    - Generally viewed as “women’s work,” whether it is performed in the home or not

- Who pays for it?
    - Can be unpaid (therefore supported by husbands' wage)
    - Can be paid (households pay other people to do the work)
    - Can be state-supported (“the social wage”)

## Relationship to Production
- In general, **social reproduction lies outside of profit-making logics and capital accumulation**
- Despite this, social reproduction is necessary for profit making!
    - Workers need to be produced, kept alive, trained
    - The habitus or cultural practices are essential to productivity, discipline, and class rule

- Things can also change; something that was previously done “for free” can become a profit-making industry
- Reproduction usually changes in tandem with changes in production
    - There’s a “dialectical” relationship between reproduction and production
    - Capitalist crisis in the 1970's led to changes in reproduction: cutting taxes, cut in social wage, changes in habitus, changes in household

- Reproduction is also the site of struggle
    - Things like education and health care can, through struggle, be about more than just profit making
    - When reproduction is outsourced/paid, the workers can organize
    - Reproduction can be politicized and seen as an important part of the struggle against capitalist inequality; “Reproduction is work!”

- There are limits to reproduction which can potentially cause a different kind of crisis
    - Mullings on the “limits to labour”

## Relationship to Geography
- Katz: "rescaling of childhood"
- Mullings: transnationalization of reproduction
- England: the importance of the household space
    - The household can define what’s reproductive work
    - Social changes in the 1970's led to childcare and other reproductive work being outsourced
    - The geography of the home makes paid work in the home “care work”, and a site of struggle for live-in caregivers!
