# Reading Notes: Knox and Pinch - Chapter 1
- Chapter topic: Social geography and the sociospatial dialectic

- **Four different approaches within human geography to understanding cities:**
    1. **The quantitative approach**
        - Attempts to provide descriptions of the spatial organization of cities using statistical data represented in the form of maps, graphs, tables, and equations
        - Attempts to be scientific and neutral; many however question if neutrality is possible since the values of a researcher will be reflected in the data with the models, words, and metaphors which are chosen to represent the data
    2. **The behavioral approach**
        - Emphasis on the study of people's activities and decision-making process (Ex: where to live) within their perceived worlds; relationship between urban settings and certain aspects of people's behavior
        - Many of these explanatory concepts are derived from social psychology and phenomenology
    3. **The structuralist approach**
        - Argue that to understand society one needs to probe beneath the external world to apprehend the underling mechanisms at work
        - Though these mechanisms cannot be observed directly, they must be studied through abstract reasoning and constructing theories
        - Despite origins in anthropology, the structuralist approach came to be combined with Marxian theories and developed into **neo-Marxist approaches**
            - Marx argued that the key underlying mechanism in capitalist society was conflict between the bourgeois and the proletariat; since these foundational Marxist ideas however class structure has become much more complex
        - The structuralist approach stresses the constraints that are imposed on the behavior of individuals by the organization of society as a whole and by the activities of power groups and institutions within it
        - Critics of structuralist and Marxian approaches argue that such approaches ignore the existence of the many other different kinds of struggle outside class (race, gender, age, sexuality, religion, etc.) and that such theories have an unrealistic sense of human agency
    4. **Poststructuralist approaches**
        - Poststructuralist approaches are strongly opposed to the idea that the world can be explained by a single underlying structure (Ex: class based conflict)
        - Instead, poststructuralist approaches argue that there are many shifting/unstable dimensions of inequality in society that are reflected in various forms of representation including language, intellectual theories, advertising, music, and city landscapes
        - All of these forms of representation involved sets of shared meanings, these shared meanings are called **discourses**
        - Thus they argue that there is no simple undistilled experience and the method by which we represent reality is as important as the underlying reality itself

    - Cities are not just physical structures, they are products of the human imagination
