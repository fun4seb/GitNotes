# GEOG330 - Week 1: Introduction
- Textbook: Urban Social Geography (Knox and Pinch)

- Topics covered this week:
    - Introduction to urban concepts

# Lecture Notes: Urban Concepts
- Urban geography seeks to explain the distribution of towns and cities and the socio-spatial similarities and contrasts that exist between and within them
    - It focuses on urban processes, relationships between cities, and their internal organization

- **What makes an "urban place"?**
    - Land uses:
        - Varied, including (industrial, services, and commerce)
    - Economy:
        - Dominated by non-primary sector activities
        - Large and small scale activities
        - Houses headquarters and specialized services
    - Population:
        - Large and diverse (age, origins, class, jobs)
    - Urbanism:
        - Lifestyle that is distinctly "urban"

- Basic **"urban terms"**:
    - City = political term, citizen & civilization
    - Municipality = incorporated political unit
    - Urban area = an area where urban land uses and functions predominate
    - Metropolis = Large city, the largest and most dominant city in a region

- Athenian **"Polis"**
    - Greek city-states were the inspiration for the Roman term civita, the root word of city
    - Each Greek polis was an independent political unit
    - The site of public life at the center of the polis was the **agora** where citizens (propertied men) gathered to trade and debate

- Montreal island pre-merger and de-merger
    - In 2002, all of the independent municipalities where forced to merge into "Once Island, One City" by the Parti Quebecois
    - In 2004, some voted to become independent again when the Liberal government came to power. Most of these were in the western portion of the island

## Urban Area
- Urbanized areas have higher population densities and developed areas,  leading to more diverse economies and land uses
    - Importantly, urbanized areas are **non-agricultural** with economies based in manufacturing and services

- Scales and integration of urban areas:
    - **Metropolitan area** = metropolis and its surrounding suburbs
        - Functional "city" to which residents are connected through employment, education, etc.
        - **Canadian CMA's** (Census Metropolitan Area)
            - One or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population center
            - Total population of at least 100,000 with 50,000 living in the core
            - A municipality must have a high degree of integration with the core (measured by commuting flows) to be included
    - **Conurbation** = regions where a number of urban areas merge
        - Forms along transportation routes which stimulate the merging of labor and consumer markets between settlements
    - **Megalopolis** = regions where metropolitan areas merge
        - Merging of urban functions at a regional scale along transportation corridors; when adjacent cities begin to form conurbations
        - Ex: Bos-Wash Corridor that connects the cities from Boston to Washington

## The Urban as a System
- "Town-ness"
    - Relationship with surrounding region
    - Regional centers of administration, religion, trade
    - Vertical, static, hierarchical
- "City-ness"
    - Cities links to other cities in other regions
    - Trading centers within much larger network
    - Horizontal, dynamic, greater parity

- Site & situation
    - Site as a **location with its own qualities** that offers specific advantages (water source, visibility, terrain)
    - Situation as a **position relative to other places**, where its position in relation to others brings specific advantages (trade, information, travel, etc.)

- Canada's urban hierarchy:
    - Canada's cities have be divided into **four tiers based on size and influence**
    - Tier 1 cities are the largest and are important nationally (Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver)
    - The importance at cities in lower tiers becomes more regional and local

## The Urban as a Process (Urbanization)
- Process of **urbanization**:
    - **Migration:** Movement of populations from rural to urban locations within a country
    - **Lifestyle change:** Settlement and occupational changes (higher densities, non-agricultural occupations) resulting in socio-cultural changes (secularization, consumption, family size, daily routine, social relationships)
    - **National process:** Shifting balance of the urban-rural population as people migrate to the city measured in % urban (urbanization levels)

## The Urban as Quality
- idea of **urbanism**
    - The result of urbanization; term coined by Louis Wirth in 1920's
    - Distinguished by "urban" lifestyles that are dramatically different from those of rural residents; a set of aesthetics attributed to the urban space that distinguish it from the rural space/peoples

- The urban as representation
    - Cultural meanings are embedded in our representation of cities
    - These shape and reflect how we understand spaces within our cities
    - **Discourses** are shared sets of meanings:
        - That filter our interpretations of the world around us
        - Reveal geographical imaginations
        - Reflect power relations
    - Urban **metaphors**:
        - Jungle, melting pot, mosaic, organism, machine

# Reading Notes: Social Geography and the Sociospatial Dialectic - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 1)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - Why are geographers interested in city structures?
    - What are the distinctive contributions that geographers can make to understanding these structures?
    - In what ways do city structures reflect economic, demographic, cultural, and political changes?

## 1.1 Different Approaches Within Human Geography
- **Four different approaches within human geography to understanding cities:**
    1. **The quantitative approach**
        - Attempts to provide descriptions of the spatial organization of cities using statistical data represented in the form of maps, graphs, tables, and equations
        - Attempts to be scientific and neutral; many however question if neutrality is possible since the values of a researcher will be reflected in the data with the models, words, and metaphors which are chosen to represent the data
    2. **The behavioral approach**
        - Emphasis on the study of people's activities and decision-making process (Ex: where to live) within their perceived worlds; relationship between urban settings and certain aspects of people's behavior
        - Many of these explanatory concepts are derived from social psychology and phenomenology
    3. **The structuralist approach**
        - Argue that to understand society one needs to probe beneath the external world to apprehend the underling mechanisms at work
        - Though these mechanisms cannot be observed directly, they must be studied through abstract reasoning and constructing theories
        - Despite origins in anthropology, the structuralist approach came to be combined with Marxian theories and developed into **neo-Marxist approaches**
            - Marx argued that the key underlying mechanism in capitalist society was conflict between the bourgeois and the proletariat; since these foundational Marxist ideas however class structure has become much more complex
        - The structuralist approach stresses the constraints that are imposed on the behavior of individuals by the organization of society as a whole and by the activities of power groups and institutions within it
        - Critics of structuralist and Marxian approaches argue that such approaches ignore the existence of the many other different kinds of struggle outside class (race, gender, age, sexuality, religion, etc.) and that such theories have an unrealistic sense of human agency
    4. **Poststructuralist approaches**
        - Poststructuralist approaches are strongly opposed to the idea that the world can be explained by a single underlying structure (Ex: class based conflict)
        - Instead, poststructuralist approaches argue that there are many shifting/unstable dimensions of inequality in society that are reflected in various forms of representation including language, intellectual theories, advertising, music, and city landscapes
        - All of these forms of representation involved sets of shared meanings, these shared meanings are called **discourses**
        - Thus they argue that there is no simple undistilled experience and the method by which we represent reality is as important as the underlying reality itself

- The study of urban social geography
    - Cities are not just physical structures, they are products of the human **imagination**
    - Plural to this are the imaginaries of **geographies**, spaces with a collective identity/personality that are attributed to it through the **language and metaphors** used to describe the space; these identities surrounding geographies also shift and change over time
        - Ex: Suburbs (female dominated, private space, socially homogeneous, "safe") vs. inner cities (male dominated, public space, socially heterogeneous, "dangerous")
        - The use of **metaphors** (describing something by referencing it to another thing; Ex: urban jungle) is central to the imagining of cities and often comes with negative connotations
            - "Metaphors are not just artistic license; they are used to understand cities and can justify different approaches to urban policy"

- The **metaphors, theories, concepts and modes of representation we use to analyze cities cannot be regarded as neutral** Instead, they tend to represent particular theoretical perspectives and interest groups

## 1.2 The Sociospatial Dialectic
- **Sociospatial dialectic** = term for continuous two-way process in which people create and modify urban spaces while at the same time being conditioned in various ways by the spaces in which they live and work (Soja, 1980); two way process in which people create and mold their environments while at the same time those very environments they must exist in shape their understanding of the geography and in turn their decisions to improve upon it

- **Space cannot be regarded simply as a neutral medium** in which social, economic and political processes are expressed. It is of importance in its own right in contributing both to the pattern of urban development and to the nature of the relationships between different social groups within the city
    - **Space and distance/proximity are undeniably important** as determinants of social networks, friendships and marriages, well-being, and quality of life as ones proximity to certain people affect the relationships that may form and ones proximity to certain amenities within a city such as food sources, schools, work opportunities affects the development of certain spaces
    - "Because the benefits conferred by proximity to these amenities contribute so much to people’s welfare, locational issues often form the focus of conflict within the city, thus giving the spatial perspective a key role in the analysis of urban politics. The partitioning of space through the establishment of **de jure** (formal, legal) territorial boundaries also represents an important spatial attribute that has direct repercussions on several spheres of urban life. The boundaries of school catchment areas, for example, have important implications for community status and housing prices, while the configuration of electoral districts is crucial to the outcome of formal political contests in the city"

## 1.3 The Macro-Geographical Context
- This book is concerned with cities in developed countries that have **"postindustrial" societies**
    - **Postindustrial societies** = societies in which industrial employment has been in decline, and employment in advance service industries (Ex: tech) has been growing
    - Usually located in Europe or North America where levels of urbanization are among the highest anywhere

- **Difference between European and North American Cities:**
    - European cities are generally **much older** (tangible legacy of earlier modes of economic and social organization)
    - European prevalence of **minority groups** within cities has been much less than in North America than until fairly recently
    - Key difference in the way **urban government** has evolved
        - Where in North America each city tends to be fragmented into a number of separate and independent municipalities, European cities are less fragmented and their public services are funded significantly by the central government leading to a fairly even allocation of resources within the city as a whole
            - This is related to another point of contrast in that Europe has much better developed **welfare states**, which in turn has profound affects on the social geography of the city such as in the housing market (prevalence of "social housing")

- A changing context for urban geography:
    - Cities in the developed world have entered a new/transitional phase away from manufacturing industries and towards service activities governed not by states but by global conglomerates fueled by the **globalization of the capitalist economy**

- Economic change and urban restructuring:
    - Since the 1970's the economies of Europe and North America have entered a different economic phase (often referred to as the **neo-Fordist regime of production**); change in **what** they produce, **how** they produce it, and **where** they produce it
        - What they produce has shifted away from agriculture and manufacturing and more towards **service industries** (particularly business/public sector services)
        - How production is organized has shifted towards **oligopoly** as large corporations out-compete smaller competitors and diversify their activities (Ex: Amazon). There has also been a shift away from mass production and towards flexible flexible production systems for niche markets (Ex: print on demand)
        - Where production takes place has seen a shift in activity towards the metropolitan, national, and international scales (largely in response to the **restructuring of global conglomerates**)
            - The shift in where production takes places (no longer within industrial areas of city centers) has resulted in the **deindustrialization** of many of the previously very industrial cities of Europe and North America

- Household demographic changes:
    - Transition towards households with two wage earners and the rise of single parent households and people living alone
    - Introduction of reliable methods of birth control and the rise of women in labor markets
    - Changes in sex culture; idea of sex not being solely for procreation led to the social value of marriage being decreased leading to further trends such as a decline in marriages, rise in divorces, increase in cohabitation without marriage

## Chapter Summary
- 1.1: Several different approaches to understanding contemporary cities; **quantitative, behavioral, structural, and poststructural**
- 1.2: Cities reflect a **sociospatial dialectic**, a two-way process in which people modify urban spaces while at the same time they are conditioned by the spaces in which they live and work
- 1.3: City structures reflect their surrounding economic, demographic, cultural, and political backgrounds; Consequently, North American cities display somewhat different characteristics to European cities
