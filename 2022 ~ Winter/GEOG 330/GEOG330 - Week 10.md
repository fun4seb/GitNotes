# GEOG330 - Week 10: Congregation & Segregation

# Lecture Notes: Congregation & Segregation
- Why are ethnic groups clustered in urban spaces?
    - **Voluntary:** based in affiliation, commonalities
    - **Enforced:** based in discrimination and exclusion

- Gerald Suttles and the Persistence of Differentiation:
    - Minimizes conflict between groups
    - Facilitates social control
    - Gives groups cohesion and a political voice
    - Preservation of lifestyle and culture

## Wirth's "The Ghetto"
- Historic study of Jewish districts
    - Historic European Jewish areas
    - American urban geography of Jewish areas
    - Jewish “ghettos” as “natural areas”
- Traced the history of the “ghetto” concept
    - Argued that Jewish ghettos were originally voluntary
    - Roman edicts in Italy the 1500's led to spatial limitation of Jewish residents
    - Venetian “gietos” were the first segregated Jewish enclaves
- Compared New York to Chicago
    - New York: Lower East Side continued the "shtetl" and ghetto
    - Chicago: The “ghetto” transitional space on the path to American assimilation

## Colony, Enclave, and Ghetto
- **Colony:**
    - Core area with some local dispersal
    - Port-of-entry for migrant group
    - Temporary first settlement of assimilation
- **Enclave:**
    - Core persists but residents disperse
    - Old colony remains symbol of community
    - Non-residential, commercial & institutional
- **Ghetto:**
    - Expands directly from the core following path of least resistance
    - Exists over several generations
    - Created by constraint imposed by host population
    - Institutionalized and informal discrimination

## Origins of the American “Ghetto”
- Drake & Cayton (1945) Black metropolis
    - Case study of Chicago’s Bronzeville area in 1930's
    - Detailed an nuanced study of highly segregated area
- Clark (1965) Dark ghetto
    - Segregation based on “skin color” was an American invention
    - Restriction of African Americans to slum areas and limited freedom
- Massey & Denton (1998) American Apartheid
    - Argues that segregation is deliberate outcome of policy
    - Created by white majority to isolate African American populations
    - Uses the term “hyper-segregation” to draw attention to intensity

### The Invention of the American “Ghetto”
- Duneier (2016) Ghetto: The Invention of Place
- A more insidious Northern racism has led to the creation, perpetuation and degradation of African American “ghettos”
- The cultural construct of the “black ghetto” is an expression of “white” power
- It has solely been shaped by external factors such as housing markets, mortgage lending, discrimination in employment, criminalization, and exploitation
- Has resulted in a restricted space with substandard infrastructures and services that is subject to social control through policing and incarceration

## Debating the Impacts of Segregation
- **Isolationist thesis:**
    - Associated with assimilationist ideals
    - Segregation
        - Limits integration into mainstream society
        - Produces sense of exclusion
        - Creates the ‘enemy within’
    - Pluralism leads to social fragmentation

- **Emancipation thesis:**
    - Associated with pluralist ideals
    - Segregation
        - Provides a supportive environment
        - Provides a place for allocation of resources
        - Can be used to compensate for disadvantage
    - Assimilation as injustice

## Studying Segregation
- **Ecological:**
    - The "natural areas" approach
    - Social distance = spatial distance
    - People are grouped together through ecological processes
- **Neo-Marxist:**
    - Segregation as social injustice
    - Segregation in space = social inequalities
    - Welfare state creates social and spatial exclusions
- **Post-Structural:**
    - Segregation as a representation of power relations
    - Segregation in space reflects to social constructions of the "other"
    - Discursive power relations produce boundaries in space

## Structural Spatial Exclusion
- **Structural housing discrimination:**
    - Red-lining: mortgage lending discrimination
    - Gate-keeping: landlords perpetuate discrimination
    - Chartering: suburban charters that discriminate
    - Zoning: discrimination through land use regulation
    - "The fabric effect": low-income minorities get channeled into limited niche
        - Localization of types of housing stock
        - Specific demands of minority groups of the housing stock
        - Channeled into limited housing niche in one area

- **Charter group tactics:**
    - Voicing: Hostility towards other groups
    - Blocking: Refusing to sell or rent to other groups
    - Exiting: Out movement after the tipping point

### Racial Covenants in Canada
- **Racial covenants** =  contractual agreements that prohibit the purchase, lease, or occupation of a piece of property by a particular group of people (Ex: minority) 
    - Racialized covenants were banned in Canada in 1978
    - West Vancouver’s British Properties property titles retained a clause banning people of African and Asian decent from living in the area
    - In 2020, West Vancouver finally passed an amendment asking the B. C. Land Registry to eradicate racialized covenants

## Social Distance & Residential Differentiation
- **Social distance** = perceptions of individuals towards other groups & identities; one's degree of interaction with a group is determined by "social distance"
    - Short: potential marriage partners
    - Medium: potential friends, colleagues, neighbors
    - Distant: unable to assimilate into social world

- Social distance in space:
    - The shorter the social distance the greater likelihood of physical proximity and vice versa

- Urban dynamic of social distance:
    - Host culture’s perception of social groups has social outcomes
    - Host culture’s perception of social groups shapes segregation

- Social distance theory and segregation:
    - The greater the perceived differences between subculture and host culture, the greater and more persistent the segregation

## Kay Anderson's “The Idea of Chinatown”
- ‘Chinatown’ is an idea that was invented and perpetuated by the ‘white, European cultural tradition
    - It is a social construction that reveals more about how the West has seen Chinese migrants, than about ‘Chineseness’

- In Canada, it was given legitimacy through institutional practices:
    - Head tax, by-laws, licensing, policing practices

- Formation of Vancouver’s Chinatown
    - Concentration due to hostilities encountered outside
    - Assigned to undesirable lands near industry

## ‘Chinatown’: Placing the ‘Other’
- Chinatown was a place created to create distance between ‘White’ and ‘Chinese’ in Vancouver

- **"Othering"** = dramatizing distance in order to define ‘white’ society at a time of uncertainty
    - "Whiteness" = morality, sanitary standards, work ethic
    - "Chineseness" = sin, disease, immorality, gambling

- Social Darwinism & urban space:
    - Naturalized the segregation of two groups on the basis of:
        - Morality: Opium, prostitution, gambling
        - Cleanliness: inspections, business licenses

## Conceptualizing Segregation
- **People and identity:**
    - How do we measure "ethnicity" and "race"
    - From country of birth, to ‘race’, to culture
    - Should we include religion?
    - How do we deal with multiple & hybrid identities?
- **Spatial constructs:**
    - Ghettoized inner-city as a construct
    - The benign ethnic enclave
    - The self-segregated community as ‘unwilling’ to join
- **Segregation:**
    - Multi-dimensional construct (evenness, centrality, etc.)
    - As a process (assimilation, polarization, etc.)
    - Ethnic segregation as social segregation:
        - High income ethnic groups are successful
        - Low-income ethnic groups are ghettoized

## The Spatial Segregation of Minority Groups
- Congregation and segregation are inversely related to **“assimilation” with the “host society”**

- This sets up a dynamic that shapes the **vocabulary** of studying and measuring segregation:
    - **Minority group** = a group who differs from the societal mainstream on the basis of ‘race’, religion, language, ethno-cultural identity, sexuality, etc.
    - **Host society or charter group** = the culture that the ‘minority group’ is embedded in, which although not homogeneous, is established and define the social environment into which they find themselves
    - **Segregation** = situations in which the minority group is not uniformly distributed throughout residential space in relation to the host society
    - **Spatial assimilation** = the extent to which the minority group has spatially dispersed throughout the residential space occupied by the host society

## The Five Dimensions of Segregation
1. **Evenness** = refers to the distribution of one or more population groups among the areal units of a city (Ex: census area). Evenness indices measure the over/under-representation of a group in the areal units of a city; the more unevenly a group is distributed over the unit, the more it is segregated

2. **Exposure** = refers to the degree of potential contact between the members of the same group (intragroup) or between members of two groups (intergroup) in an areal unit. It measures the probability of a group member meeting a member of their group (isolation) or a member of another group (interaction) in their areal unit

3. **Concentration** = refers to the actual physical space occupied by a group. The smaller the proportion of the city a group occupies, the more the group is concentrated

4. **Clustering** = the more a group occupies contiguous areas of a city (thereby forming an enclave in the city) the more segregated it is in terms of clustering

5. **Centralization** = centralization indices measure the distance between the group and the center of the urban area, which is normally defined as the business center and surrounding area (CBD). The closer a group is to downtown, the more centralized and segregated it is

- "A group that is highly centralized, spatially concentrated, unevenly distributed, tightly clustered, and minimally exposed to majority members is said to be residentially segregated"

## Measuring Segregation
- **Index of dissimilarity:**
    - Extent to which two groups are found in equal proportion in all neighborhoods
    - The proportion of individuals of either group that would have to move in order to achieve perfect integration
    - Measures relationship between two groups (where 0.00 = an even distribution, and 1.00 = complete segregated)
- **Index of isolation:**
    - Tendency for members of one group to live in isolation from the larger population
    - Predicts the likelihood that the members of one group will mix with the larger population locally
    - Measures the isolation of one group from the whole population (where 0.001 = no isolation, and 1.00 = complete isolation)
- **Index of exposure:**
    - Tendency for members of one group be exposed to another group
    - Predicts the likelihood that members of one group will mix with another group locally (not the whole population)
    - Measures the exposure of two groups to each other (where 0.00 = no exposure and 1.00 = complete exposure)

## Walks & Bourne's Ghettos in Canadian Cities?
- Visible minority & poverty concentrations
- DIS and Johnston’s taxonomy of ethnic areas; linked to poverty measures
- Segregation:
    - Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver & Winnipeg
    - Varied by group & city
- Immigration & poverty
    - Linked for some CTs but not others
    - Strongest in low rent apartment districts
- No link: Racial concentration & poverty

## Principle Functions of Congregation
- **Defense:**
    - Territorial "heartland" reduces isolation and vulnerability
    - Important when discrimination levels are high
- **Support:**
    - Port-of-entry and ‘haven’ function
    - Economic, institutional, and social ‘self-help’
- **Preservation:**
    - Promotes and preserves cultural heritage
    - Clustering promotes identity, specific lifestyles
- **Attack:**
    - Neighborhood as basis for political action
    - Community form of political representation

## Social Cohesion and Immigrant Enclaves
- Clustering together provides networks of social capital, knowledge, economics, and culture
- It promotes social cohesion, the social bonds and institutions of society or community located in physical space
- Having a common ground of civil, economic and political rights enables individuals within (ethnic) communities to fulfill their full potential
- Social cohesion is negatively impacted by segregation because it limits that potential

## The "Ethnoburb"
- **Ethnoburb** = an area where there is a clustering pattern of an ethnic group located outside the central core but they are not dominant
- A term coined by Wei Li to describe the suburban clustering of Chinese residents in Los Angeles in the 1990's
- Compare the advantages of “congregation” in the San Gabriel Valley to the city’s historic inner-city Chinatown:
    - Larger, more modern housing stock
    - Business opportunities
    - Accommodates more diverse diaspora communities

## Castells' The City and the Grassroots (1983)
- Case study of San Francisco’s Castro District
- Queer life had long taken place in more central areas like the Tenderloin and the Mission
- As gay identity and activism emerged in the late 1960s, gay men increasingly moved into a former working-class Irish area, the Castro
- Gay men in the Castro:
    - Consistently increased their presence
    - Created neighborhood, institutions and commerce
    - Claimed territory & became a political constituency

## Stages in the Development of Gay Enclaves in England (Collins’ Stage Model)
- **Stage 1 "pre-conditions":** urban area in decline, location of sexual and legal liminal activities and behavior
    - Marginal area showing extensive physical decay
    - Presence of street-based and/or near off-street (predominantly heterosexual) prostitution
    - Significant stock of vacant commercial premises
    - Low property prices/rental values
    - Typical presence of at least one gay licensed public house
- **Stage 2 "emergence":** clustering of gay male social and recreation opportunities
    - Conversion of some other nearby licensed public houses into "gay run" pubs
    - Increase in applications made for liquor licenses to support conversion of some other existing commercial premises into gay nightclubs or additional licensed public houses
    - Upgrading or renovation of existing gay pubs in the area
    - Substantial increase in gay male customer base and pub revenue stream
- **Stage 3 "expansions and diversification":** widening gay enterprise service-sector base
    - Conversion of some other existing commercial premises for gay service-sector enterprises (gay health clubs, saunas, retail/lifestyle accessory stores, cafe-bars, etc.)
    - Further applications for liquor licenses and planning permission for additional gay nightclubs
    - Increasing gay household density in existing stock of residential units in the gay village locale
    - Increasing physical visibility and public awareness of the urban gay village to mainstream society via its community media
    - Increasing significant and sustained contribution to the gay service-sector enterprises' revenue streams from gay tourists
- **Stage 4 "integration":** assimilation into the fashionable mainstream
    - Increasing presence of heterosexual custom in mainly gay bars/pubs
    - Conversion of some existing commercial premises for mainstream social service-sector enterprises (bars, pubs, restaurants)
    - Influx of young urban professionals to the existing stock of residential units in the gay village
    - Outflow and suburbanization of early gay residential colonizers
    - Increasing applications and construction of new-build (apartment) residential units in the gay village
    - Increasing significance and sustained contribution to gay service-sector enterprises' revenue streams from the heterosexual community

## Toronto’s Gay Village
- In the 1970's, gay politics focused on ‘liberation’ and adopted an ‘anti-ghetto’ discourse
- Following police raids of bath houses in 1978 and negative press stereotypes of gay men activists adopted ‘ethnic minority model’
- Promoted a territorial model of community following the enclave model

## A New Gay Urban Politics
- Combating Violence, Building Institutions
    - Increasing Village public security
    - Building gay community infrastructure
    - The Fight for Parc de l’espoir
- Civil Rights and AIDS Politics
    - Applying Charter Rights City Hall
    - Municipal HIV Prevention Campaign
    - Support for C-SAM
- Metropolitan Conflicts
    - The red-light and the displacement of sex work
    - The municipal ban on sexually explicit signage

# Reading Notes: Segregation and Congregation - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 8)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - Which ‘minority groups’ are most residentially segregated in Western cities?
    - What are the processes responsible for these patterns?

## 8.1: Social Closure, Racism and Discrimination
- Frank Parkin’s (1979) notion of **social closure**, whereby ‘winners’ are characterized by their ability to exercise power in a downward direction, excluding less powerful groups
    - Parkin also calls this **exclusionary closure**; an example would be the explicitly exclusionary practices of housing classes defined through membership of homeowners’ associations from desirable spaces and resources

- Another means of differentiating ‘winners’ from ‘losers’ is through the social construction of **racism**
    - Racism produces pejorative associations aimed both at individuals (Ex: sexuality, criminality) and at social groups (Ex: family structures, cultural pathologies)

- The critical point here is that racism is **not a uniform or invariable condition of human nature** but, rather, consists of sets of attitudes that are rooted in the **changing material conditions of society**; We can therefore identify a multiplicity of racisms within contemporary cities, depending on the particular circumstances of different places

- Susan Smith (1988) adopted this perspective in suggesting that the interaction of political culture with economic contingency produced **three distinctive phases of racism in post-war Britain:**
    1. **1945–1960:** a period during which blacks and Asians, although frequently regarded as culturally backward or morally inferior, were regarded as intrinsically British, sharing equally with whites the status and privilege of Commonwealth citizenship 
    2. **1961–1975:** civil unrest in the Notting Hill area of London (in 1958) marked the turning point at which blacks and Asians ceased to be regarded as fellow citizens and began to be depicted as alien, with alien cultures, different temperaments, backgrounds and ways of life
    3. **1976-now:** a period of social authoritarianism, in which neoliberal economic philosophies have defined issues of race as being insignificant to the concerns of politics and the economy, while at the same time a resurgence of moral conservatism, in appealing to a revival of national pride, has reinforced racism, albeit in the disguised language of ‘culture’ or ‘ethnicity’

- Smith’s emphasis on the interaction of political culture and economic circumstances is particularly important to our understanding of racial segregation in societies (such as Britain and America) where **institutional discrimination carries racism into the entire housing delivery system**

- **Behavioral assimilation** (the acquisition by the minority group of a cultural life in common with the charter group) may take place faster than **structural assimilation** (the diffusion of members of the minority group through the social and occupational strata of the charter group society)

- The rate and degree of assimilation of a minority group will depend on two sets of factors:
    1. external factors, including charter group attitudes, institutional discrimination and structural effects
    2. internal group cohesiveness

## 8.2: The Spatial Segregation of Minority Groups
- We can interpret minority group residential congregation and segregation as being inversely related to the process of **assimilation** with the host society
    - Minority groups resist complete assimilation into the host society through congregating into segregated areas where they can retain their culture

## Chapter Summary
- 8.1: The residential segregation of minority groups in Western cities is the product of various processes of exclusionary closure and institutional racism
- 8.2: Minority groups reveal differing degrees of residential segregation in cities. These patterns reflect hostility among the wider population, discrimination in employment and housing markets, and, clustering for defense, mutual support, and cultural preservation
