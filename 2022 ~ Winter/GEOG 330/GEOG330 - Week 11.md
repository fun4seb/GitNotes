# GEOG330 - Week 11: Neighborhood & Community

# Lecture Notes: Neighborhood & Community
- **Community** = Social group with a degree of social coherence who are interdependent and share cultural characteristics
- **Neighborhood** = Territories containing people of broadly similar characteristics who identify with a local socially cohesive community based in shared institutions

## What Makes a Neighborhood a "Community"?
- History: bonds of shared past, long-term ties to the area
- Identity: identifiable neighborhood features
- Mutuality: interdependence and reciprocity among members
- Plurality: multiple forms of neighborhood association
- Autonomy: distinct leadership, representation, jurisdiction
- Participation: defined roles and means of engagement
- Integration: wide-spread inclusion and spirit of volunteerism
- Interests: shared values, interests, and objectives

## Importance of "Immobility" in Neighborhood Communities
- Relative immobility in space strengthens communities in neighborhoods through:
    - Vertical bonds of kinship
    - Horizontal bonds and friendship
    - Propinquity intensifies these interactions

- Stress and conflict also result from deep ties and interdependencies

## Neighborhood Community Example: Bethnal Green, East London
- ‘Green’ set aside for the use of the poor; poorest area of London in 19th & 20th Centuries
- Silk weaving & market gardening

- Immobile deprived population
    - Poor housing conditions
    - "Culture of poverty"
    - Long-term kinship patterns

- Strong sense of neighborhood and community
    - Mutual aid and support
    - Based on kinship and matriarchy

## Urbanism Debates: Communities Lost or Saved
- **"Community lost" perspective:**
    - Village Gemeinschaft: deep relationships based on kinship, continuity, cohesion & fulfillment
    - Urban Gesellschaft: specialized relationships based on rationality, efficiency & special interests
- **"Community saved" perspective:**
    - Cities are full of small villages
    - Social cohesion & identity reinforced in urban neighborhoods
    - Each neighborhood has a distinctive sense of place

- The community lost perspective is saying that ones intimate sense of community, as seen in small villages, is lost within urban environments
- The community saved perspective is saying that urban environments are filled with small and cohesive villages where social cohesion is strong and comparable to rural villages

## Compositionalist Urbanism
- Non-ecological perspective of US urban sociologists in the 1960s
- **Argument:** urbanism has no direct effect on social life; lifestyles shaped elsewhere endure in the city
- Patterns of kinship, ethnicity, occupation, class constrain individual choice

- Herbert Gans' The Urban Villagers (1962):
    - Case Study of Boston’s West End in 1950s
    - ‘Slum’ district below Beacon Hill under threat of demolition
    - Population:
        - Mixed immigrant enclave (Italian, Jewish, Polish, & Irish)
        - Bohemians and students
        - Mixed low-income & Middle-class
    - Urban life does not lead to social disorder
    - ‘Village-like’ social pattern of support

## Sub-Cultural Theory of Urbanism
- Claude Fischer's Sub-cultural Theory of Urbanism (1976)
- **Argument:** Cities create, and even strengthen, subcultures
    - Break bonds of pre-existing communities
    - Critical mass leads to the creation of subcultures
    - Subculture are defined as groups touch and recoil
    - The larger the city, the more subcultures

## "Community Transformed" Perspective: Suburban Communities
- Factors of ‘anti-community’ within suburbs:
    - Short term, life cycle specific
    - Based on nuclear family
    - Family and kinship ties not routed in space
    - Based on privatization & materialism
    - Privatized physical environment
    - Lack of informal ‘communal’ public space
    - Homogeneous populations

- Crisis of communality
    - Threats to property & status
    - NIMBY Syndrome

## Sylvia Fleis Fava's “Suburbanism as a Way of Life” (1956)
- Urbanism: diversity, autonomous secondary contracts, and low neighboring
- Suburbanism: socio-psychological selectivity, compassionate relations, high neighboring
- Rural: integrated primary-group interactions, deep dense networks, permeable, public-private relations

## Herbert Gans' "The Levittowners"
- Suburbs of ‘communities of limited liability’
- Far from kinship networks
- Separate from work spaces & organizations
- Short-term, single purpose
- Based on loose-knit secondary relations
- Community participation as choice
- Based on self-selecting criteria:
    - School & leisure activities
    - Voluntary organizations
    - Neighborhood-based institutions

## Suburban ‘Neighboring’
- Self-selection creates homogeneity
- Similar leisure and social activity preferences
- Detached housing lends itself to local social life
- Distance from the city forces ‘settling’ for local contacts
- Pioneer eagerness to make friends
- ‘Neighboring’ in semi-public spaces

## Suburban Community Types
- **Exclusive upper-income suburbs:**
    - Situated in the outer-most part of city
    - Large detached homes with extensive grounds
    - Local interaction in clubs & institutions

- **Middle-class family suburbs:**
    - Detached single-family dwellings
    - Primacy is placed on family privacy
    - Local interaction based on the nuclear family & child care
    - Social interaction reinforced by overlapping activities

- **Suburban cosmopolitan centers:**
    - Suburban neighborhoods where personal networks extend beyond local area
    - Cohesive communities based on artistic & intellectual networks and activities that overlap
    - Found around suburban universities

- **Working-class suburbs:**
    - Working class residents & diverse housing stock
    - High levels of social interaction & use of public space
    - Reproduction of working-class community in suburbs
    - Less mobility, establish local ties

# Reading Notes: Neighborhood, Community, and the Social Construction of Space - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 9)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What has been the effect of urbanization upon community life?
    - How do people construct images of urban environments and how do these affect the way they live their lives?
    - What are the social meanings incorporated within the built environment?

## 9.1: Neighborhood and Community
- **"Community lost" argument:** urban life in cities is not conducive to "community" (close-knit kinship groups of deep social connections); opinion of classical sociologists such as Tönnies, Durkheim, Simmel, Sumner, and Wirth
- **"Community saved" argument:** (According to Herbert Gans) "we need not mourn the passing of the cohesive social networks and sense of self-identity associated with village life because these properties exist within the inner city in a series of **‘urban villages’**"

- **Urban village** = areas where there is a "sense of community" (either based on class or ethnicity) and a feeling of solidarity between people who occupy the common territory’ based on a strong local network of kinship, reinforced by the localized patterns of employment, shopping and leisure activities
    - Urban villages are most likely to develop in long-established working-class areas with a relatively stable population and a narrow range of occupations
    - Importance of permanence and immobility in fostering the development of local social systems in which the community depends on

- Myth of the suburban "non-community"
    - It was previously thought by scholars that suburban life is the antithesis of community as it lacks the close-knit social networks of the urban village
    - Despite this view it is evident that many suburban neighborhoods contained localized social networks with a considerable degree of cohesion; "suburban neighborhoods can be thought of as **'communities of limited liability'**, a series of social groups in which residents can choose to participate" **("community transformed" perspective)**
        - Instead of viewing suburban communities as breaking up, they can be seen as breaking down into an ever-increasing number of independent and localized sub-groups or communities in which social-networks are made and reinforced (Ex: PTA, country clubs, bingo clubs, etc.)

- Neighborhood vs. community
    - **Neighborhoods** = territories containing people of broadly similar demographic, economic and social characteristics, but are not necessarily significant as a basis for social interaction
    - **Community** = exist where a degree of social coherence develops on the basis of interdependence, which in turn produces a uniformity of custom, taste and modes of thought and speech

## 9.2: The Social Construction of Urban Places
- **Place** = area/space with a constructed identity that can be re-made

- idea of the **"betweenness of place"**; ideas/perceptions of place are dependent on perspective (ideas of a place internally are different from the external ideas of that same place made by "outsiders")
    - Places exist and are constructed from a subjective point of view; they are simultaneously being constructed and seen both internally as a member, and externally by outsiders; places have meaning in direct proportion to the degree that people feel ‘inside’ that place
    - "Our neighborhood is both an area centered on ourselves and our home, as well as an area containing houses, streets and people that we may view from a decentered or an outsiders perspective. Thus place is both a center of meaning and the external context of our actions" (Nicholas Entrikin)

- Human strategy/tendency of **territoriality** = the idea that humans have an innate desire to occupy a specific territory to satisfy needs of safety, security and privacy and to enable the expression of personal identity

- Heidegger’s ideas on the importance of **‘dwelling’** = the basic capacity to achieve a form of spiritual unity between humans and the material world
    - Through repeated experience and complex associations, our capacity for dwelling allows us to **construct places and to give them meanings** that are deepened and qualified over time with multiple nuances
    - In the modern world, deepening and multiple layering of meaning is subverted by the spread of telecommunications technology, rationalism, mass production and mass values; City spaces become inauthentic and ‘placeless’ in a process that is ironically reinforced as people seek authenticity through professionally designed and commercially constructed spaces that all make for convergence rather than spatial identity

- The construction of place by ‘insiders’ cannot take place independently of societal norms and representations of the world; Both our territoriality and our sense of dwelling are informed by broadly shared notions of social distance, rules of comportment, forms of social organization, conceptions of worth and value, etc.
    - **Important dialectical relationship:** between social structures and the everyday practices of the ‘insiders’ of subjectively constructed spaces and place; the practices of insiders shape social structures, while at the same time social structures shape the practices of insiders within places

- Place is a setting for **social interaction** that:
    - Structures the daily routines of economic and social life
    - Structures people’s life paths, providing them with both opportunities and constraints
    - Provides an arena in which everyday, ‘common-sense’ knowledge and experience is gathered
    - Provides a site for processes of socialization and social reproduction
    - Provides an arena for contesting social norms

- Idea of the **lifeworld** = the taken-for-granted pattern and context for everyday living (shaped by this dialectic relationship) through which people conduct their day-to-day lives without having to make it an object of conscious attention

- The basis of both individual lifeworlds and the collective structure of feeling is **intersubjectivity**: shared meanings that are derived from the lived experience of everyday practice
    - Part of the basis for intersubjectivity is the **routinization** of individual and social practice in time and space

- The **temporality of social life** can be broken out into three interrelated levels:
    1. The **longue durée** of social life is bound up with the historical development of institutions (the law, the family, etc.)
    2. Within the **dasein** (one's lifespan), social life is influenced by the life cycle of individuals and families and (interacting with the longue durée) by the social conditions characteristic of their particular generation
    3. Within the **durée** of daily life, individual routines interact with both the structure of institutional frameworks and with the rhythm of their life cycle

- The **spatiality of social life** can also be broken down into three dimensions:
    1. At the broadest scale there is **institutional spatial practice**, which refers to the collective level of the social construction of space
    2. **‘Place’** can then be thought of as related to the human consciousness and social meanings attached to urban spaces
    3. **Individual spatial practice** refers to the physical presence and spatial interaction of individuals and groups

- Combining these three dimensions of temporality and spatiality, multidimensional framework can be constructed within which time–space routinization is able to foster the intersubjectivity upon which people’s lifeworlds depend
    - The best-known element of this framework to geographers is the **time–geography of daily life** that has been elaborated by Torsten Hägerstrand

- Torsten Hägerstrand's basic model **captures the constraints of space and time on daily, individual spatial practices**; It illustrates the way that people trace out ‘paths’ in time and space, moving from one place (or ‘station’) to another in order to fulfill particular purposes (or ‘projects’)
    - This movement is conceptualized as being circumscribed by three kinds of constraints:
        1. **Capability constraints:** the time available for traveling and the speed of the available mode of transportation
        2. **Authority constraints:**  laws and customs affecting travel and accessibility
        3. **Coupling constraints:** resulting from the limited periods during which specific projects are available for access

- The significance of time-geographies in the present context is that groups of people with similar constraints are thrown together in **‘bundles’** of time–space activity; routine patterns that are an important precondition for the development of intersubjectivity (Ex: a group of people at the same workplace, existing in a specific geography at a specific time)

- **Structuration theory** = theory which addresses the way in which everyday social practices are structured across space and time (developed by Anthony Giddens)
    - Structurationist theory holds that human landscapes are created by knowledgeable actors (or agents) operating within a specific social context (or structure)
    - The structure–agency relationship is mediated by a series of institutional arrangements that both enable and constrain action. Hence three ‘levels of analysis’ can be identified: **structures, institutions, and agents**
        - Structures include the long-term, deep-seated social practices that govern daily life, such as law and the family
        - Institutions represent the phenomenal forms of structures (Ex: the state apparatus)
        - And agents are those influential human actors who determine the precise, observable outcomes of any social interaction

- Structures and social systems can be seen to develop across broader spans of space and time through "system integration", which takes place through time–space **distanciation** (the ‘stretching’ of social relations over time and space as ideas, attitudes, and norms are spread through print and electronic media)

## Chapter Summary
- 9.1: Despite many views to the contrary, cities have not resulted in the destruction of community networks, but these have been radically transformed through decentralization, suburbanization and social polarization
- 9.2: Places develop complex multilayered meanings depending upon the views of those who live within them, as well as those who live outside. These meanings have an important influence upon the ways people go about their everyday lives
- 9.3: The landscape of cities tends to reflect the prevailing ideology of the times; a complex mixture of political, economic and cultural forces.
