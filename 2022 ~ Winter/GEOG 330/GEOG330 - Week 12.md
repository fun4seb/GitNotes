# GEOG330 - Week 12: Environmental Perception and Behavior

# Lecture Notes: Environmental Perception and Behavior
- Perceptions and behavior in urban settings:
    - Our behaviors in urban settings are shaped by how we perceive them
    - The relationship between urban settings and behavior is reciprocal:
        - “A neighborhood takes its character from the values and lifestyles of its residents; however, reciprocally, its personality is also a context that acts to reinforce and narrow range of possibilities” (Ley, 1983)
    - The personality of an urban setting influences individual and group behavior

- Behavioral model in human geography:
    - Real world > sense (information) > perceptual receptors > perceptual filters > value system (culture) > **transformed cognitive image** (recall) > decision based on this image > behavior

- Urban images:
    - **Designative** = Aspects of people’s imagery that relate to the mental organization of space necessary to orient themselves in the urban environment
    - **Appraisitive** = Aspects of people’s imagery that reflect their feelings about the environment that are related to decision-making within the urban environment

## Environmental Images
- Results from a two-fold process:
    - The environment suggests distinctions
    - The observer selects, endows, and gives meaning to the environment
 - Three components:
    - Identifiability: set of distinct objects
    - Structure: relationships between them
    - Meaning: significance of the elements

- Valuing the image:
    - Sufficiency: be distinguishable enough to be useful
    - Clarity: readable enough as an image
    - Safe: consistent enough to be relied upon
    - Open-Ended: adaptable to change and reorganization
    - Communicable: distinct enough it can be communicated to others

- **Designative Images (Lynch, 1960)**
    - Paths: channels of movement
    - Edges: barriers to movement
    - Districts: ares with identifiable characteristics
    - Nodes: Strategic focal points; the b•Clarity: readable enough as an image ranching of two paths
    - Landmarks: physical reference points

## Five Elements of the Image
1. **Paths:**
    - The network of habitual or potential lines of movement that give order to the whole
    - Singular character that marks them from others (tree- or shop- lined)
    - Lines of motion that connect and serve as the city’s skeleton (streets, transit lines)
2. **Edges:**
    - Physical barriers between areas that form lines that mark a transition
    - Strongest when there is continuity of form that distinguishes between inside and outside
    - Strong edges are features around which everything else is aligned (cliffs, waterfront, walls)
3. **Landmarks:**
    - A singular and unique component of the landscape that contrasts with surroundings
    - Most notable when it has clarity of form or invites the eye due to detail and texture
    - Used for orientation within the system but can be of any scale (doorknob or a dome)
4. **Nodes:**
    - Physically distinct gathering places where paths meet
    - Strongest when bounded or have a distinct feature at their center
    - Serve as conceptual anchor points in the system (public squares, transportation hubs)
5. **Districts:**
    - A distinct area recognized by clues that are continuous and distinct from surroundings
    - Spatial characteristics, building features, sets of three or four unique continuous characteristics
    - Serve as the building-blocks of the whole city (shopping districts, old areas, business, enclaves)

## Different Cognition of Urban Residents
- Peter Orleans (1973) argued that the cognitive image of the city would vary by social world
- Respondents with broad scale contacts were most able to produce a generalized image of Los Angeles
- Respondents with more constricted social contacts had an attenuated world view often limited to a few blocks
- Site recalcitrance increased inversely with social contacts outside the residential area

## Orleans’ (1973) Study of Designative Images of Los Angeles
- Los Angeles Planning Commission study Done with Kevin Lynch
- Our knowledge of our environment and the way we visualize and symbolize it is a consequence of our experience determined by:
    - Our physical location and associated barriers of space and time
    - Our social position and attached normative requirements
- Our social worlds shape how we see the city
- The scale of our cognitive maps is determined by our social worlds
    - Range: the wider our range of social contacts, the larger our maps
    - Intensity: the more strongly embedded in one area, the smaller our maps

- **Designative Image of Los Angeles: Westwood**
    - Based on a sample of “non-ethnic” upper-class residents
    - Well-formed, generalized image of the whole Los Angeles area like an actual map of the city
    - Identification of many details in the center North area but somewhat lacking details of South Los Angeles

- **Designative Image of Los Angeles: Avalon (near Watts)**
    - The designative images of residents of Avalon, a predominantly African American neighborhood, was described as constricted
    - The most important features were the street running toward the downtown
    - Knowledge of other areas was abstract and there was little to no interstitial information

- **Designative Images of Los Angeles: Boyle Heights**
    - The images drawn by the predominantly Spanish speaking population of this area was even more limited
    - It included an area of only a few blocks near the downtown
    - The map of the city was the same as a map of their neighborhood

## Urban Settings and Behavior
- Perceptions of urban settings have often been tied to behaviors
- But most of the literature in this field focuses on urban ‘deviance’ as a behavioral adaptation to city or neighborhood life
- From Wirth, the increased size, density and diversity of urbanism requires that people cope with more environmental stimuli, resulting in:
    - **Alienation:** withdrawal, emotional buffering, and aloofness
    - **Egocentricity:** unrestrained, individualistic, and unconventional behaviors
    - **Aloneness:** lack of social support resulting in neurosis, addictions and anti-social behaviours

## ‘Deviance’ as Urban Behavior
- **Psychological overload:** 
    - Impersonal and unfamiliar environments lead to overstimulation
    - Leads to a dissociation with reality, role segmentation, impersonality
- **Crowding:**
    - High urban densities constrain the space of individual personal expression
    - Leads to aggression, withdrawal and group or individual territoriality
- **Design determinism:**
    - Designed urban environments can discourage community life
    - Leads to loss of social norms and deviant behaviours
- **Alienation:**
    - Urban juxtapositions of differences enhances exclusion and inequality
    - Leads to feeling of disempowerment, alienation and distrust by the system

## The Bystander Effect
- Will people intervene with strangers when they are in public spaces?
- Latane and Darley’s (1968) Columbia University study demonstrated that it depends on whether one is alone or in a group
- Our sense of responsibility diminishes depending on how many people are around
- Further, people who are alone are more likely to notice others but those in groups are preoccupied with group dynamics

## Crowding and the “Behavioral Sink”
- Calhoun (1962) created a utopic space for rats that became overcrowded and led them into a “behavioral sink”, a **collapse of norms due to overcrowding**
- Studies later showed that this could not be extrapolated to humans because they do not react to overcrowding in the same way; they become hyper-social and socially cohesive

## Proxemics
- Edward T. Hall (1963) defined proxemics as “the interrelated observations and theories of human use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture”
- Interpersonal communication conveyed through proxemic behavior (the use of space) from the scale of the body, to the social dynamic on the street, to the organization of homes and cities
- Personal space describes the immediate space surrounding a person, territory refers to the area which a person may "lay claim to" and defend against others
- These different levels of territory, suggest ways for us to communicate and produce expectations of appropriate behavior

- **Four forms of human territory/space:**
    1. Public territory: a neutral zone where one may freely enter; not under the control of anyone
    2. Interactional territory: social space where people congregate informally
    3. Home territory: personal space where individuals have continuous control
    4. Body territory: intimate space, the space immediately surrounding us

## Situational Behaviors
- Situational behaviours are not psychic states
- People adapt their behaviours according to types of spaces
- In public spaces, we block out strangers and adopt non-intrusive behaviours
- Sidewalks are perceived as neutral zones shared by everyone

## Goffman’s Dramaturgic Theory
- Goffman argued that our situational behavior is adjusted to the expectations of the setting that provide a set of clues (norms) as to what is expected dependent upon time, place, and audience

- Front stage behavior:
    - A performance that reflects internalized norms and expectations for behavior shaped partly by the setting, the particular role one plays in it, and by one's physical appearance that requires an audience
- Back stage behavior:
    - When we are free of the expectations and norms that dictate front stage behavior, getting relief from being observed, but the standards of the front stage and its audience still impact us
- Off-stage behavior:
    - When we are not in the state of front or backstage and are unaware of the observation of others and not preparing or performing for an audience and are uninhibited

## Territoriality
- **Territoriality** = the tendency of groups to establish some form of control, dominance and exclusivity in public space making it into a focus for group membership and identity
    - Territoriality involves inserting a boundary around public space, making it into an intermediate space over which there is some control

- Jurisdictional Areas in Victory Square
    - Observation in Victory square between 7:00 and 11:00 am indicated that there were three predominant lifestyle with distinctive territorial patterns that rarely overlapped

- Graffiti as a territorial marker
    - David Ley examined the density of graffiti in the Monroe district of inner-city Philadelphia and found that it was densest around the boundaries of gang territory

## The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces
- William Whyte's’ 1971 Street Life Project evolved into an observational study of how people use small urban spaces such as plazas in New York
- Although he examined everything from sunlight to the size of the chairs, he found that what attracted people to public spaces was other spaces
