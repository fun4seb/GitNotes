# GEOG330 - Week 2: Thinking Urban Geography
- Topics covered this week:
    - Different approaches to urban social geography
    - The Socio-spatial dialectic

# Lecture Notes: Thinking Urban Geography
- Pre-1990 perspectives/approaches:
    - **Quantitative** = Uses statistical data to describe the spatial organization of cities
        - Source: Neo-classical economics
        - Claims: Objectivity and separation of observer from the observed (Cartesian approach)
        - Problem: There’s no such thing as neutral science
    - **Behavioralism** = Observation and surveys to understand people’s behavior in the urban environment
        - Source: Phenomenology and behavioral sociology
        - Claims: People make decisions in relation to perceptions and meanings of the environment
        - Problem: Power relations are absent, environmentally determinist
    - Humanism
        - Rejects: Structural constraints on individuals
        - Focus: Individual perception & "meaning"
    - **Structuralism** = uses abstract reasoning to understand the dialectical forces underlying structural oppression
        - Source: 19th century Marxist theory for the contemporary world (neo-Marxism)
        - Claims: Underlying mechanism of capitalism (conflict over value) shapes space (inherently unstable)
        - Rejects: Human agency & individual perception
        - Problems: Economically determinist, abstract, no human agency

- Contemporary perspectives/approaches:
    - Managerialism
        - Rejects: Neo-Marxist class concept
        - Focus: Power of urban managers to shape cities
    - **Poststructuralism** = Interpretation of cultural processes shaping inequalities (racism, gender, etc.)
        - Rejects: One underlying structure (class)
        - Claims: Inequality sifted through cultural values; reflected in representations (discourses)
        - Problems: Stuck in critique, no theory
    - Postmodernism
        - Rejects: "Grand theory" & emphasize "difference"
        - Focus: Understand city from multiple viewpoints
    - Moral philosophy
        - Rejects: post-modern "relativism"
        - Focus: Comparing "actual" & "ideal" conditions

## The Socio-Spatial Dialectic
- **Socio-spatial dialectic** = two-way process; the reciprocal relationship between people and cities (Soja, 1980)
    - The process in which people are continually shaping and modifying urban spaces while simultaneously being influenced by the very space in which they live and work
    - Space itself is therefor a part of social processes

- Urban social geography...
    - Examines urban social structure, cultural representations, and experiences of cities
    - Views the city as a social process
    - Integrates economic, demographic, political, and cultural forces
    - Focuses on European and North American cities

### Lefebvre's "Urban Revolution"
- Urban revolution is a dialectic process, where there is a constant tension between the old and new order and internal contradictions
- The urban revolution signifies a long historical shift from an agricultural to an industrial to an urban world in three phases:
    1. Agrarian
    2. Industrial
    3. Urban
- Corresponds with shifts in the internal organization of the city, from the political city of pre-medieval times to the mercantile city, then industrial city, and finally to the present phase where "urban" becomes a global trend

- Lefebvre's production of space: (Lefebvre's conceptual triad)
    - Espace perçu **(Spatial Practice); Materialist**
        - Production and reproduction of spatial relations in space
        - Each social formation has a particular set of locations
    - Espace conçu **(Representations of Space); Idealist**
        - Conceptual spaces, mental and idealist space
        - Provide conceptual order for the relations of production
        - Space as organized and designed by planners, scientists, etc.
    - Espace vécu **(Representational Space); Social**
        - Space as a lived experience, the space of the inhabitants
        - Direct experience of the system images and symbols
        - Shaped by dialectic between other two (material & ideal)

## Four Major Realms of Change in Contemporary Cities
1. **Urban restructuring**
    - Deindustrialization, decentralization of manufacturing and low-end services, recentralization of producer services, splintering urbanism
2. **Demographic change**
    - Changing household structure, shifts from familism to consumerism, rise of cosmopolitanism, lower living wages for workers, shifting gender relations
3. **Cultural change**
    - From production to consumption, rise in home-ownership, new values and subcultures in relation to consumerism (liberal, ecological, postmodern etc.) that dovetail the middle-class consumerism and materialism
4. **Political change**
    - Dismantling of the welfare state, rise of the entrepreneurial city, inner city politics replaced with middle class liberalism, suburban conservatism
