    - In what ways did industrial capitalism affect the structure of cities?
    - What is meant by the Fordist city?
    - How has neo-Fordism influenced city structures?
    - What has been the impact of globalization upon the social geography of cities?

## 2.1 The Pre-Capitalist, Pre-Industrial City

## 2.2 The Growth of the Industrial City

## 2.3 The Contemporary City

## Chapter Summary
- 2.1: Preindustrial cities were essentially small-scale ‘walking’ cities. Although they displayed an element of vertical differentiation based on social divisions within the districts of the occupational guilds, their main division appears to have been that between the **elite who lived in the exclusive central core** and the **mass of population who lived around the periphery of the city**
- 2.2: Industrial capitalism inverted the structure of the preindustrial city by **forcing the poor into the poor-quality, inner-city districts** while the **middle and upper classes retreated to the urban periphery**. The polarized class structure of the early industrial cities was gradually replaced by more complex social divisions that made the capitalist class less easily identifiable
- 2.3: The ‘long boom’ of Fordism brought about a relatively **harmonious linking of mass production and consumption** that was manifest in extensive **suburbanization**. The numerous problems associated with the Fordist economic system led to various neo-Fordist developments that have been manifest in new urban forms based around agglomerating industries
- 2.4: **Globalization** has had profound impacts upon cities, leading to the emergence of **world cities**, centers of corporate and financial control. It has also fostered increased competition between cities and intensified social polarization
- 2.5: New telecommunications systems have allowed the exchange of ever more complex information over greater distances. However, as yet, they have not been associated with a decline in the strength of cities as centers for information production and exchange

# Reading Notes: Los Angeles and the 'California School' - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 14.1)
- **Chapter Summary:**
    - The "Los Angeles School" has portrayed Los Angeles as a harbinger of urban developments to be seen elsewhere
    - This claim (and whether Los Angeles can be envisaged as a general model of urban development) is much disputed

- Extensive writings of the **Chicago School of urban sociology** in the early part of the twentieth century meant that **Chicago** came to be regarded as the classic example of an **industrial city**
    - In recent years an extensive body of work by a group of scholars based in California has meant that **Los Angeles** has come to be seen as the archetypal **‘postmodern’ city** 

- Underlying themes of the California School:
    - Attempts to link the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles with a new regime of flexible accumulation manifested in high-technology agglomerations based around dynamic creative industries such as movie production, and industrial clusters based around low-skilled/illegal workers
    - Los Angeles as a young city that displays little of the typical industrial legacy found in industrial-era cities, allowing it to be the site for new urban forms such as a **reduced significance of the central business district and the present of many competing decentralized centers (multiple nuclei model)**
        - This dispersion was made possible by the newly widespread adoption of the automobile for transportation

- This **dispersion** and **lack of recognizable pattern** has been a key theme developed by the Los Angeles School

- **Bunker architecture**;

## Critique of the LA School
- First major criticism of the California School: 
    - Members of the California school see Los Angeles as representative of future urban forms, however it is debatable if Los Angeles can be viewed as a general model for future urban developments

- Second major criticism of the California School is their silence on the matter of **race** and its impact on the development of Los Angeles

- Third major criticism
