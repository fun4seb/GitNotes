# GEOG330 - Week 3: Urban Structure and Development
- Exploring the history of urbanization and transition into the industrial city and beyond

# Lecture Notes: Urban Structure and Development
- Interested in the socio-spatial dialectic in relation to the development of cities; how have large scale socio-economic changes shaped cities

## Urban Hearths
- There are around **8 hearths of urbanization**; strongly linked to the agricultural revolution
    1. Mesoamerica
    2. Andean America
    3. West Africa
    4. Nile River Valley
    5. Mesopotamia
    6. Indus River Valley
    7. Ganges River Valley
    8. Wei/Huang Rivers

- Urbanization in these lands was mostly driven by **sedentary** agriculture, trade, religious and political organization, and social stratification
    - Demand for central places to store agricultural surplus, conduct trade, etc.; such spaces would become cities
    - Sedentary farming and surplus food storage created the need for permanent settlements, further leading to the diversification of labor (organic labor; not everyone is farming) and thus to social stratification

## Agricultural Surplus Theory
- **Agricultural Surplus Theory** = the development of permanent settlements and cities is dependent on the creation of **agricultural surplus**

- **Steps leading to development of cities following the agricultural surplus theory:**
    1. Domestication of plants & animals
    2. Agricultural surplus
    3. Liberation from subsistence
    4. Demand for Trade
    5. Demand for central places
    6. Urban occupations
    7. Social stratification
    8. Urban society

### Idea of "Hydraulic" Civilizations
- **Hydrological/hydraulic societies** = a social or government structure which maintains power and control through **exclusive control over access to water**
    - It arises through the need for flood control and irrigation, which requires central coordination and a specialized bureaucracy

- Most powerful early civilizations developed alongside/between rivers due to the power that control over water brings
    - Ex: Egyptian & Harappan urbanization; development of agricultural surplus and trade was highly dependent on the society's advantageous location in relation to major rivers

## Other Factors Fueling Urbanization
- **Religion:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed to serve religious leaders
    - Religious leaders organized the production/stockpiling of surplus
    - Cities as centers of religious worship and power
- **Defense:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed to create a protected environment for leaders and their peoples
    - Trade and social organization developed within walls
- **Governance:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed as centers of power and monuments to political leaders
    - Religious structures and walls were for control

## Catal Huyuk (7000 BC)
- **Antithesis to the ancient archetypal city**; "the ancient city that was not a city"
    - Proto-city settlement, located in Anatolia Turkey
    - Resource town for obsidian miners
    - Composed entirely of **domestic** structures
    - No public buildings, **no social hierarchy**; i.e. not a city

- Catal Huyuk is presented to counter the idea that agricultural surplus created the worlds first cities (agriculture surplus theory)
    - It is an ancient example of a "city" that emerged first and developed agriculture later

- **Problem with this example:** this is **not a city**, it is a proto-city used for gathering resources equivalent to a mining camp; does not refute the agricultural surplus theory
    - Missing many of the key qualifiers of urban space; does not have any monuments or public buildings, no social hierarchy, etc.

## Babylon Reconstruction (2000 BC)
- Center of the Babylonian Empire
- Center held castle and ziggurat
- Surrounded by two walls
- First appearance of suburbs (growing settlements outside city walls); what Sjoberg calls "Faubourg"

- **Structure/pattern of urban development emerges:**
    - Symbolic powerful center
    - Domestic mixed area surrounding center
    - Wall
    - Outer settlements/suburbs

## Mohenjo-Daro (2000 BC)
- The first "planned" city, built by Harappan people of Pakistan (Indus River Valley)
- Elevated citadel, "the great granary", public baths, public buildings, well system, central marketplace

## Chang'an (700 CE)
- Main city of the Tang dynasty and end of the Silk Road
- Contained palaces, markets, temples
- Designed according to Taoist principles of symmetry and oriented in the cardinal directions; "rectilinear" planning structure

## Machu Pichu (15th Century CE)
- Built by the Incas as part of a network of cities in the Andes
- Royal estate of Pachacutec; full of temples, palace structures, and homes for nobility

- Exception to the typical circular development of cities (influenced by the topography of the Andes)

## Pre-Industrial Cities
- Typical qualities of pre-industrial cities:
    - Organic street layout; no organization or structure of growth
    - Densely populated and compact
    - Center of trade and artisan production
    - Centered on a core zone housing the market, temple, and granary/government buildings

- Why did pre-industrial cities share these qualities?
    - Necessity to be close to the center

### Pre-Industrial City Model (Sjoberg)
- Model to understand and describe the structure of pre-industrial cities
    -  **Core of the city:** (elites and dominant institutions)
        - Temple
        - Market
            - Where the agricultural surplus is sold
        - Granary
            - Where the agricultural surplus is stored
    - **Surrounding the city center:** (artisans and merchants)
        - Guild district
            - Form of urban organization around occupation
        - Ethnic districts
            - Ex: Jewish districts in ancient cities
    - **Outside the city walls:** (domain of the serfs/outcast groups)
        - Farms
        - Faubourg (first suburbs)
            - Home to the working poor, traveling merchants, farmers, non-citizens

- **Class structure/pyramid of pre-industrial cities:**
    1. Elites (few)
        - Religious and political leaders in charge of the agricultural surplus (and thus economy)
    2. Lower class (moderate amount)
        - Merchants and artisans
    3. "Outcasts" (many)
        - Serfs/indentured laborers; peasants
        - Not allowed to live within city walls

### Archetypal Pre-Industrial City: Medieval Paris
- Roman site on river for access and trade
- Circular form derives from necessity to access the center
- Organic street pattern
- Central access running into center from the hinterland
- Surrounded by farms

- Medieval Paris as the quintessential city exemplifying Sjoberg's model for pre-industrial city development

## The Rise of the Industrial City
- Begins in Europe in the 18th century; product of the **industrial revolution**
- Industrial colonial system of production **changed the spatial order** (how cities were organized)
    - Production became centralized in cities
    - Enclosure moment forced farmers off of common lands
    - Mass urbanization transformed the social structure

- Industrial cities have unique **pulling and pushing** factors that draw people in while also pushing some away
    - **Pull factors:**
        - Availability of jobs; economic stability
    - **Push factors:**
        - Low wages
        - Poor working conditions

- Industrial cities emerged due to the forces of **industrialization & urbanization:**
    - **Mode of production:**
        - Forces of production: new technology allows for industry to thrive
        - Relations of production: new division of labor (capitalist system)
    - **Technology:**
        - Inanimate energy (coal, steam engine)
        - Innovation in machinery and transportation (transportation allows for workers to reach industry zones)
    - **Division of labor:**
        - Capitalist: owns means of production
        - Proletariat: sells labor
    - **Urban form:**
        - Large scale urbanization & expansion
        - Inner-city slums & flight of the middle class

## Industrial Cities
- Large populations (reaching 500,000 or 1,000,000 in 19th century)
- Powered by steam, electricity, petrochemicals
- Centers of industrial production and distribution
- Centered on factory, railway, banks, and transportation (CBD)
- Vertical expansion through increased building height
- Class segregation with increase in social status away from center
    - Leads to development of **suburbs** (wealthy classes living in periphery) and **slums** (poor working class living close to center)

### Industrial City Model (Chicago School)
- City organized as a series of **concentric zones** centered on the central business district and industrial zones (means of production): 
    1. Innermost layer is the **central business district (CBD)**
    2. Industrial zone surrounding the city center
    3. Zone of transition (slums); dynamic zone between the inner city and working class residential zone
    4. Working class zone (middle class worker)
    5. Residential zone (suburbs)
    6. Commuter zone

### The Capitalist City
- Makes use of "economies of scale"; costs of producing and selling products are cheaper (per product) if you produce them en mass

- Land becomes **private property** (enclosure movement)
- Competition for space (changing spatial order)
    - Capitalist land-uses:
        - Factories
        - Transportation infrastructure
        - Offices and banks
    - Residential zones:
        - Working-class needed affordable housing near work (inner-city slums)
        - Middle and upper class begin to move out of the center (suburbs)

- Industrial class structure:
    - **Capitalists**
        - People who own the means of production
        - Comprised of merchants who accumulated capital and dominate urban government
    - **Proletariat**
        - People displaced by the mechanization of farming
        - They sell their labor and pay rent to the capitalists
    - **New Middle-Class**
        - People who work for the capitalists to organize the means of production
        - Expands as a class as the industrial city grows

### Archetypal Industrial City: Manchester
- The first archetypal industrial city; named "Cottonopolis" as Manchester developed to be the world center of cotton production
- Over 30 years between 1800 and 1830, the city was totally transformed by the forces of the Industrial Revolution and the Capitalist mode of production

- **Pre-conditions to industrialization in Manchester:**
    - It had good transportation links
        - Port of Liverpool
        - Coal fields in Wigan
    - Rivers Irk and Irwell gave power and transportation
    - Center of weaving since the 16th century
        - Sheep farming woolen center
        - Putting-out system of spinners and weavers
        - Growing wealth of local merchants due to weaving (merchants will grow to become the leaders of industrial cities under capitalism)
    - Mechanization of farming created a captive labor force that must now work for food
    - Iron production for factory buildings and machines
    - No pre-existing medieval infrastructure (no courts, walls, guilds, etc.)
        - No guilds means no powers to oppose mechanization and industrialization
    - Its most important buildings were churches and the stock exchange

- **Industrial Manchester:**
    - New growth in the sprawl of the city
    - New built forms:
        - Factory and commercial buildings
        - Banks and the exchange
    - Increase in population (demonstrated by the increase in number of churches)
    - Signifies the emergence of a new type of city based on **wealth generation and production**

- Engels' observations of Manchester in the 1840's outlined in his book **"The Condition of the Working Class in England" (1845)**
    - He observed that around the center of the city is the **"Industrial collar"** where one can see all of the below characteristics taking place and concentrated in the city center
    - Lack of sanitation; lead to disease outbreak
        - Cellar dwellings
        - Back-to-back housing
    - Lack of zoning; mix of industry and housing
    - Class segregation

- Conditions in the **"Industrial Collar"**
    - Mixed land uses with no zoning
    - Back-to-back housing mixed with industrial land uses
    - High pollution levels due to industry
    - Overcrowding in dwellings
    - Lack of privies and sanitation

- Back-to-back housing in Manchester:
    - Built to accommodate the rapidly increasing population
    - Dwellings share party walls on three of their four sides, with the front wall having the only door and windows
    - High density levels, lack of ventilation, overcrowding
    - Shared central courtyard

## A New Social Geography
- As industry is exported through the colonial settler process, a new social geography emerges that sees the city centered around the industrializing CBD (concentric zone model)

- Center/CBD: symbols of industrial city
    - Stock exchange
    - Offices
    - Rail lines, stations and yards
- Transition zone:
    - Mills, factories
    - Working-class housing
- Suburbs: middle and upper-class homes

## Expansion of North American Industrial Cities
- Between the late 1700's and 1929, US cities grew dramatically in terms of **land area**
- Once primarily small port, urbanization and transportation innovations expanded the **extent of cities**

- Expansion dynamics of the Industrial City:
    - Centrifugal forces; **the outward expansion of...**
        - Higher class residences move outward to escape industrial city life
        - Household retailers
    - Centripetal forces; **the inward expansion of...**
        - Factories, warehouses, offices, hotels move inward to create industrial city life
        - Specialized retailers
    - Vertical forces; **the upward expansion of...**
        - Buildings (skyscrapers); allows for increased efficiency within the same building footprint
        - Transportation; allows for the wealthy and working class to commute to the center, enables outward expansion

- Economies of scale:
    - Economies of scale seek to cut costs by decreasing the cost per unit of production and increasing the amount of production, thus decreasing the turn-around time to bring goods to the market
    - A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale of production by expanding market share and decreasing purchase price
    - Economies of scale require **expanded production spaces** for assembly line production and large labor pools

- Assembly line production:
    - Economies of scale rely on the assembly line to increase efficiency
        - Workers on the line specialize in different stages of the process 
    - First used in Chicago by Armour to break down the steps of pig slaughter into progressive steps done by workers along a line, allowing for faster efficiency
    
## Phases of Transportation Technology
1. **Walking and horse car era (pre-1890)**
    - Individual mobility within 4-6 km
    - Only allows high density around a single center
2. **Streetcar era (1890-1940)**
    - Mass transit brings collective mobility
    - Allowed city to expand outwards along streetcar lines (star shaped pattern)
    - Allows for the specialization of land uses & classes
3. **Early automobile era (1920-1945)**
    - Cars and buses increase all forms of mobility
    - Expansion and "filling in" around areas where the streetcar line didn't allow access (circular pattern)
4. **Highway era (1945+)**
    - The construction of highways lead to expansion of the fringe
    - Increased individual mobility
    - Decentralization of jobs and residents

- Relationship between transportation & density; how transportation allows cities to expand in certain ways
    - Increased speed of transportation in Phase 2 (streetcars) expanded the area of the city and lowered densities along tramlines (star-shaped cities)
    - Individual forms of transportation in Phase 3 (automobiles) extended and filled in the middle areas previously untouched due to the rigidity of the tram lines
    - In the highway era (Phase 4), densities increase around suburban downtowns or "edge cities"

## Chicago as the Archetypal American Industrial City
- Chicago became the archetypal city of the industrial age
- It was seen as "paradigmatic" of the North American industrial city, an archetype of its social organization and structure

- **Chicago's concentric zones:**
    - Loop I: CBD
    - Zone II: Zone in transition
    - Zone III: Workers' homes
    - Zone IV: Residential zone

- The rise of the **office** in Chicago
    - The industrial city also brought the separation of home and work and initiated commuting to the central city
    - The office, a place from which to manage production and capital, clustered in the central area of Chicago's "loop"

- The rise of the **department store** in Chicago
    - With the creation of large scale retailing in the central city, the department store implanted consumption as a central function
    - Consumption no longer literally meant purchasing goods because window technology and shop displays spectacularized the goods on offer; you do not need to buy anything to participate in consumption (Ex: you can just walk around a department store)

- Factory zones in Chicago:
    - An American extension of Engels' "industrial collar", factory zones spread out horizontally in the "Zone in Transition"
    - They displaced housing and came to dominate the band around the central business district
    - Chicago's meatpacking district on its South-side provides an example of a large specialized zone completely dedicated to industry and organized to accommodate the assembly line

- "Bright lights" districts (entertainment districts):
    - Specialization of land uses brought "brought lights districts", concentrations of entertainment establishments such as cabarets or theaters usually advertised by brightly lit entrances especially with marquees
    - Usually zoning and permits, civic leaders could effectively concentrate all such activities in specific areas so as to protect "family neighborhoods" aggregating them with taverns and hotels

- Immigrant districts:
    - As a result of mass migration from Europe and the Great Migration of African Americans from the South, distinctive neighborhoods formed in the inner-city which had their own institutions and commerce at their center along shopping streets

- Workers' housing:
    - Homes for workers were built using assembly line techniques on small lots defined by the city's grid patterned streets, giving the middle zones of the city and industrialized uniformity 

- Suburbs:
    - Riverside, west of Chicago, was designed in 1869 by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted as an elite bedroom community served by a commuter train line
    - In contrast with industrial Chicago, the town's plan was **picturesque**, with curvilinear streets, landscaped topography, and the winding Des Plaines River. The plan included a central village square, main railroad station, and a Grand Park system

# Reading Notes: The Changing Economic Context of City Life - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 2)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What were the main characteristics of the pre-industrial city?
    - In what ways did industrial capitalism affect the structure of cities?
    - What is meant by the Fordist city?
    - How has neo-Fordism influenced city structures?
    - What has been the impact of globalization upon the social geography of cities?
    - What are the likely effects of new technologies upon urban form?

## 2.1 The Pre-Capitalist, Pre-Industrial City

## 2.2 The Growth of the Industrial City

## 2.3 The Contemporary City

## Chapter Summary
- 2.1: Preindustrial cities were essentially small-scale ‘walking’ cities. Although they displayed an element of vertical differentiation based on social divisions within the districts of the occupational guilds, their main division appears to have been that between the **elite who lived in the exclusive central core** and the **mass of population who lived around the periphery of the city**
- 2.2: Industrial capitalism inverted the structure of the preindustrial city by **forcing the poor into the poor-quality, inner-city districts** while the **middle and upper classes retreated to the urban periphery**. The polarized class structure of the early industrial cities was gradually replaced by more complex social divisions that made the capitalist class less easily identifiable
- 2.3: The ‘long boom’ of Fordism brought about a relatively **harmonious linking of mass production and consumption** that was manifest in extensive **suburbanization**. The numerous problems associated with the Fordist economic system led to various neo-Fordist developments that have been manifest in new urban forms based around agglomerating industries
- 2.4: **Globalization** has had profound impacts upon cities, leading to the emergence of **world cities**, centers of corporate and financial control. It has also fostered increased competition between cities and intensified social polarization
- 2.5: New telecommunications systems have allowed the exchange of ever more complex information over greater distances. However, as yet, they have not been associated with a decline in the strength of cities as centers for information production and exchange

# Reading Notes: Los Angeles and the 'California School' - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 14.1)
- **Chapter Summary:**
    - The "Los Angeles School" has portrayed Los Angeles as a harbinger of urban developments to be seen elsewhere
    - This claim (and whether Los Angeles can be envisaged as a general model of urban development) is much disputed

- Extensive writings of the **Chicago School of urban sociology** in the early part of the twentieth century meant that **Chicago** came to be regarded as the classic example of an **industrial city**
    - In recent years an extensive body of work by a group of scholars based in California has meant that **Los Angeles** has come to be seen as the archetypal **‘postmodern’ city** 

- Underlying themes of the California School:
    - Attempts to link the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles with a new regime of flexible accumulation manifested in high-technology agglomerations based around dynamic creative industries such as movie production, and industrial clusters based around low-skilled/illegal workers
    - Los Angeles as a young city that displays little of the typical industrial legacy found in industrial-era cities, allowing it to be the site for new urban forms such as a **reduced significance of the central business district and the present of many competing decentralized centers (multiple nuclei model)**
        - This dispersion was made possible by the newly widespread adoption of the automobile for transportation

- This **dispersion** and **lack of recognizable pattern** has been a key theme developed by the Los Angeles School

- **Bunker architecture**;

## Critique of the LA School
- First major criticism of the California School: 
    - Members of the California school see Los Angeles as representative of future urban forms, however it is debatable if Los Angeles can be viewed as a general model for future urban developments

- Second major criticism of the California School is their silence on the matter of **race** and its impact on the development of Los Angeles

- Third major criticism 

## Los Angeles: A Paradigmatic City?
