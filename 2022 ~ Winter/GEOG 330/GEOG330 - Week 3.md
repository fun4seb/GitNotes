# GEOG330 - Week 3: Urban Structure and Development
- Exploring the history of urbanization and transition into the industrial city and beyond

# Lecture Notes: Urban Structure and Development
- Interested in the socio-spatial dialectic in relation to the development of cities; how have large scale socio-economic changes shaped cities

## Urban Hearths
- There are around **8 hearths of urbanization**; strongly linked to the agricultural revolution
    1. Mesoamerica
    2. Andean America
    3. West Africa
    4. Nile River Valley
    5. Mesopotamia
    6. Indus River Valley
    7. Ganges River Valley
    8. Wei/Huang Rivers

- Urbanization in these lands was mostly driven by **sedentary** agriculture, trade, religious and political organization, and social stratification
    - Demand for central places to store agricultural surplus, conduct trade, etc.; such spaces would become cities
    - Sedentary farming and surplus food storage created the need for permanent settlements, further leading to the diversification of labor (organic labor; not everyone is farming) and thus to social stratification

## Agricultural Surplus Theory
- **Agricultural Surplus Theory** = the development of permanent settlements and cities is dependent on the creation of **agricultural surplus**

- **Steps leading to development of cities following the agricultural surplus theory:**
    1. Domestication of plants & animals
    2. Agricultural surplus
    3. Liberation from subsistence
    4. Demand for Trade
    5. Demand for central places
    6. Urban occupations
    7. Social stratification
    8. Urban society

### Idea of "Hydraulic" Civilizations
- **Hydrological/hydraulic societies** = a social or government structure which maintains power and control through **exclusive control over access to water**
    - It arises through the need for flood control and irrigation, which requires central coordination and a specialized bureaucracy

- Most powerful early civilizations developed alongside/between rivers due to the power that control over water brings
    - Ex: Egyptian & Harappan urbanization; development of agricultural surplus and trade was highly dependent on the society's advantageous location in relation to major rivers

## Other Factors Fueling Urbanization
- **Religion:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed to serve religious leaders
    - Religious leaders organized the production/stockpiling of surplus
    - Cities as centers of religious worship and power
- **Defense:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed to create a protected environment for leaders and their peoples
    - Trade and social organization developed within walls
- **Governance:**
    - The first cities (may have) developed as centers of power and monuments to political leaders
    - Religious structures and walls were for control

## Catal Huyuk (7000 BC)
- **Antithesis to the ancient archetypal city**; "the ancient city that was not a city"
    - Proto-city settlement, located in Anatolia Turkey
    - Resource town for obsidian miners
    - Composed entirely of **domestic** structures
    - No public buildings, **no social hierarchy**; i.e. not a city

- Catal Huyuk is presented to counter the idea that agricultural surplus created the worlds first cities (agriculture surplus theory)
    - It is an ancient example of a "city" that emerged first and developed agriculture later

- **Problem with this example:** this is **not a city**, it is a proto-city used for gathering resources equivalent to a mining camp; does not refute the agricultural surplus theory
    - Missing many of the key qualifiers of urban space; does not have any monuments or public buildings, no social hierarchy, etc.

## Babylon Reconstruction (2000 BC)
- Center of the Babylonian Empire
- Center held castle and ziggurat
- Surrounded by two walls
- First appearance of suburbs (growing settlements outside city walls); what Sjoberg calls "Faubourg"

- **Structure/pattern of urban development emerges:**
    - Symbolic powerful center
    - Domestic mixed area surrounding center
    - Wall
    - Outer settlements/suburbs

## Mohenjo-Daro (2000 BC)
- The first "planned" city, built by Harappan people of Pakistan (Indus River Valley)
- Elevated citadel, "the great granary", public baths, public buildings, well system, central marketplace

## Chang'an (700 CE)
- Main city of the Tang dynasty and end of the Silk Road
- Contained palaces, markets, temples
- Designed according to Taoist principles of symmetry and oriented in the cardinal directions; "rectilinear" planning structure

## Machu Pichu (15th Century CE)
- Built by the Incas as part of a network of cities in the Andes
- Royal estate of Pachacutec; full of temples, palace structures, and homes for nobility

- Exception to the typical circular development of cities (influenced by the topography of the Andes)

## Pre-Industrial Cities
- Typical qualities of pre-industrial cities:
    - Organic street layout; no organization or structure of growth
    - Densely populated and compact
    - Center of trade and artisan production
    - Centered on a core zone housing the market, temple, and granary/government buildings

- Why did pre-industrial cities share these qualities?
    - Necessity to be close to the center

### Pre-Industrial City Model (Sjoberg)
- Model to understand and describe the structure of pre-industrial cities
    -  **Core of the city:** (elites and dominant institutions)
        - Temple
        - Market
            - Where the agricultural surplus is sold
        - Granary
            - Where the agricultural surplus is stored
    - **Surrounding the city center:** (artisans and merchants)
        - Guild district
            - Form of urban organization around occupation
        - Ethnic districts
            - Ex: Jewish districts in ancient cities
    - **Outside the city walls:** (domain of the serfs/outcast groups)
        - Farms
        - Faubourg (first suburbs)
            - Home to the working poor, traveling merchants, farmers, non-citizens

- **Class structure/pyramid of pre-industrial cities:**
    1. Elites (few)
        - Religious and political leaders in charge of the agricultural surplus (and thus economy)
    2. Lower class (moderate amount)
        - Merchants and artisans
    3. "Outcasts" (many)
        - Serfs/indentured laborers; peasants
        - Not allowed to live within city walls

### Pre-Industrial Medieval City: Paris
- Roman site on river for access and trade
- Circular form derives from necessity to access the center
- Organic street pattern
- Central access running into center from the hinterland
- Surrounded by farms

- Medieval Paris as the quintessential city exemplifying Sjoberg's model for pre-industrial city development

## The Rise of the Industrial City
- Begins in Europe in the 18th century alongside the **industrial revolution**
- Industrial colonial system of production changed the spatial order (how cities were organized)
    - Production became centralized in cities
    - Enclosure moment forced farmers off of common lands
    - Mass urbanization transformed the social structure

# Reading Notes: The Changing Economic Context of City Life - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 2)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What were the main characteristics of the pre-industrial city?
    - In what ways did industrial capitalism affect the structure of cities?
    - What is meant by the Fordist city?
    - How has neo-Fordism influenced city structures?
    - What has been the impact of globalization upon the social geography of cities?
    - What are the likely effects of new technologies upon urban form?

## 2.1 The Pre-Capitalist, Pre-Industrial City

## 2.2 The Growth of the Industrial City

## 2.3 The Contemporary City

## Chapter Summary
- 2.1: Preindustrial cities were essentially small-scale ‘walking’ cities. Although they displayed an element of vertical differentiation based on social divisions within the districts of the occupational guilds, their main division appears to have been that between the **elite who lived in the exclusive central core** and the **mass of population who lived around the periphery of the city**
- 2.2: Industrial capitalism inverted the structure of the preindustrial city by **forcing the poor into the poor-quality, inner-city districts** while the **middle and upper classes retreated to the urban periphery**. The polarized class structure of the early industrial cities was gradually replaced by more complex social divisions that made the capitalist class less easily identifiable
- 2.3: The ‘long boom’ of Fordism brought about a relatively **harmonious linking of mass production and consumption** that was manifest in extensive **suburbanization**. The numerous problems associated with the Fordist economic system led to various neo-Fordist developments that have been manifest in new urban forms based around agglomerating industries
- 2.4: **Globalization** has had profound impacts upon cities, leading to the emergence of **world cities**, centers of corporate and financial control. It has also fostered increased competition between cities and intensified social polarization
- 2.5: New telecommunications systems have allowed the exchange of ever more complex information over greater distances. However, as yet, they have not been associated with a decline in the strength of cities as centers for information production and exchange

# Reading Notes: Los Angeles and the 'California School' - Knox and Pinch (Chapter 14.1)
- **Chapter Summary:**
    - The "Los Angeles School" has portrayed Los Angeles as a harbinger of urban developments to be seen elsewhere
    - This claim (and whether Los Angeles can be envisaged as a general model of urban development) is much disputed

- Extensive writings of the **Chicago School of urban sociology** in the early part of the twentieth century meant that **Chicago** came to be regarded as the classic example of an **industrial city**
    - In recent years an extensive body of work by a group of scholars based in California has meant that **Los Angeles** has come to be seen as the archetypal **‘postmodern’ city** 

- Underlying themes of the California School:
    - Attempts to link the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles with a new regime of flexible accumulation manifested in high-technology agglomerations based around dynamic creative industries such as movie production, and industrial clusters based around low-skilled/illegal workers
    - Los Angeles as a young city that displays little of the typical industrial legacy found in industrial-era cities, allowing it to be the site for new urban forms such as a **reduced significance of the central business district and the present of many competing decentralized centers (multiple nuclei model)**
        - This dispersion was made possible by the newly widespread adoption of the automobile for transportation

- This **dispersion** and **lack of recognizable pattern** has been a key theme developed by the Los Angeles School

- **Bunker architecture**;

## Critique of the LA School
- First major criticism of the California School: 
    - Members of the California school see Los Angeles as representative of future urban forms, however it is debatable if Los Angeles can be viewed as a general model for future urban developments

- Second major criticism of the California School is their silence on the matter of **race** and its impact on the development of Los Angeles

- Third major criticism 

## Los Angeles: A Paradigmatic City?
