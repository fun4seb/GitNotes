# Lecture Notes: Post-Modern Urbanism
- Topics of this class:
    - Fordism & Keynesianism
    - Post-industrial cities
    - Chicago School vs. LA School
        - Concentric zone model (Chicago School)
        - Post-Modern Urbanism (LA School)

## Neo-Marxist Theory
- Economic base (the mode of production)
    - Forces of production (technology)
    - Means of production (investments)
    - Relations of production (laws and policies)

- Circuit of production
    - Forces of production drives mode
    - Relations of production impede the forces
    - Means of production generate surplus
    - Capitalists and proletariat are inherently in conflict

## Regulation Theory
- Mode of regulation: regulation mechanisms developed in the interests of the institutions that govern these spheres
- Regime of accumulation: the sets of arrangements that link production and consumption are referred to as a **regime of accumulation**
    - System of labor, organization of production and social organization

- Ex: Fordism, neo-Fordism, flexible specialization

## Fordist Mode of Production
- Mass production:
    - Economies of scale
    - Intensification of labor
    - Assembly line production
        - Mechanization
        - Standardization of components, process, production
        - Minute division of labor
        - Replacement of skilled labor
        - Increased pace of production
        - Increased role of management

- To be "Fordist" = To standardize a product and manufacture it by mass means at a price so low that the "common man" can afford to buy it

## Keynesian Long Boom
- Period of economic prosperity under **Keynesian** policies

- State intervention in economy:
    - Regulates wages (high wage = high productivity)
    - Raise state funds through taxation
    - Expenditure (spend to increase investment)

- Link mass production to mass consumption:
    - High wages = high demand for goods (and the means to buy them)
    - High demand = high profits (surplus)

- Policies such as this led to the post-WWII period characterized by mass consumption and production of American industries
    - Ex: Boom of suburbia, automotive industry

## From Fordism to Flexibility
- Economies of scope
- Knowledge of economies
- Corporate restructuring
    - Vertical disintegration
    - Subdivision & subcontracting
    - Reduction of overhead costs ("just-in-time" production)
    - "Flexible" labor (temporary jobs, multi-tasking)
    - Differentiation of markets (targeting niche markets)

- Globalization dynamics:
    - Recentralization in global urban centers
    - Decentralization to periphery and suburbs (weakening importance of industrial centers within cities)

## Post-Industrial Cities
- Dominated by the automobile
- Centers for service (retail and office)
- Center dominated by office towers and consumption
- Inner-city decline and gentrification
- Expansion of urban fringe
- Growth of "edge cities" and exurbia

- **Classic industrial city model:**
    - Centered around the CBD (Central Business District) and industrial zone
    - Surrounding this core are the working class residential districts
    - On the outer periphery are the middle class suburbs

- **Post-industrial city model:**
    - Centered around a "spectacular" site of consumption (within the CBD)
        - Central business district also acts as a global command center for international companies; function of world cities
    - Surrounding the CBD is the inner city, a zone that experiences **gentrification**
    - In the outer periphery are diverse suburban communities
    - Outside the city are **"edge cities"** and gated communities
    - Also outside the city are industrial zones and high-tech industrial spaces (Ex: Silicon Valley)

## Chicago and LA Schools as Archetypes
- **Chicago School:**
    - Modernist interpretation
        - City as ordered
        - Functional model
        - Interpretation based on evidence
    - Modernist city
        - Functional
        - Ordered
        - Rational

- **LA School:**
    - Postmodern interpretation
        - City as disorder
        - Impossible to model
        - Interpretation based on theory
    - Postmodern city
        - Illogical
        - Disordered
        - Irrational

## Dear & Flusty (LA School)
- City shaped by competing (dialectical) forces:
    - Globalization & industrial restructuring
    - Social polarization
    - Politics of nature

- Dreamscapes & heterotopias of elites
    - Edge cities, gentrification, theme parks, interdictory spaces

- "Ghettos" and carceral cities of marginal
    - Homelessness, public exclusion, poverty

## Keno Capitalism and Urban Structure
- A distinct form of urbanism emerged that is:
    - Center-less in form
    - Disorganized in structure
    - Shaped by multiple and competing forces
    - Mosaic of many cities in one
    - Lacks relationship between parcels
        - Grid used to show juxtapositions
        - Each parcel is co-present but disconnected

## Critiques of Postmodern Urbanism
- **Epistemological:** Is postmodernism the best framework?
- **Methodological:** How "real" are the findings?; Where are the ethnographic accounts?
- **Historical:** How "new" are postmodern characteristics?
- **Paradigmatic:** Is LA really that representative?
- **Exclusions:** Where are the women?; What role does race play?

## Assigned Critiques
- Curry & Kenney: The Paradigmatic City
    - One city cannot represent global economy
    - LA is an economically declining city except for in entertainment

- Hackworth: Emergent Urban Forms
    - The urban landscape is not more or less complicated than before (densities, income, and housing values are predictable)

- Nijman: The Paradigmatic City
    - There isn't enough comparative research to say that LA represents postmodernism
    - Miami is more representative

- Poulsen et al: From Modern to...
    - Racial segregation is not more pronounced in LA (higher in Chicago & NYC)

- Schearmur: Clash of Epistemologies
    - The LA School rejects evidence and focuses on interpretation
    - Using evidence it is possible to model LA

- Spain: What Happened to Gender
    - Changing gender relations are amongst the most significant changes in the postmodern city

# Reading Notes: Postmodern Urbanism - Dear & Flusty
> This reading is the central text for Assignment 1. Please read it for the overall concept and avoid getting bogged down in Dear and Flusty's "neologisms", essentially newly coined words that characterize the new concepts they are introducing. Our goal with this paper is to critically evaluate their proposal that contemporary North American cities may be more like Los Angeles than Chicago, the paradigmatic city of the industrial era

- Key topics:
    - Keno capitalism
    - LA as the "paradigmatic city"
    - Edge cities
    - City as a theme park
    - Fortified city
    - Fordist vs. post-Fordist regimes of accumulation and regulation

- Arguing that cities no longer follow the concentric ring model of the Chicago school, and rather follow the **keno-capitalism** model
