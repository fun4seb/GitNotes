## What is Culture?
- **Materialist view:** web of behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs from material circumstances
    - Culture as a "way of life"
- **Symbolic view:** a distinct set of values and beliefs that shape material outcomes
    - Culture as a "way of seeing"
- **Post-Structuralist view:** ideological regime of capital accumulation
    - Culture as an "instrument of capital"
- **Post-Modernist view:** a multiplicity of shifting identities
    - Culture as "difference"

### Subsystems of Culture
- Artifacts **(technological)**
    - Material objects and practices used for survival
- Socio-facts **(sociological)**
    - The institutions that regulate how individuals relate to the groups
- Menti-facts **(ideological)**
    - Ideas, beliefs, and the ways in which they are expressed

## Cultural Landscape
- A characteristic and tangible outcome of the interactions between people and their environments
- Every cultural area has a corresponding cultural landscape
- To understand a culture, a geography must learn to read the landscape
- Carl Sauer, The Morphology of Landscape (1920's & 1930's)

### Landscape as Palimpsest
- A **palimpsest landscape** is one where, in any given region, the different landforms that make up the landscape are **not of the same age**
- A useful way to conceptualize the development of a palimpsest landscape is to consider each successive episode of landscape change to be a different **"layer"** laid as a blanket across the landscape's surface
- A landscape is the sum of erasures and additions, a process that is **continuous**

- **The Archimedes Palimpsest**
    - A palimpsest is a manuscript or piece of writing material on which the original writing has been effaced to make room for later writing but of which **traces remain**
    - Archimedes' Codex C was a mathematical treatise written in the 3rd century that was refused to make a pray book in 1229 AD
        - The text was unbound and scrapped off due to lack of available parchment

## Post-Modern Representations
- **Iconography** = symbols & signs and their "meanings"
- **Discourses** = shifting representations of people & places that are shaped by social relations
- **Semiotics** = the study of signifying practices that convey discourses

## Modern & Post-Modern Aesthetics
- **Modern:**
    - Urban society: **universal culture**
    - Architecture: functional, new, universal
        - Skyscrapers, public housing, factories
    - Cities:
        - Chaotic melting pot
        - Productive machine

- **Post-Modern:**
    - Urban society: plural & diverse; **regional culture**
    - Architecture: eclectic, trans-historical, symbolic, regional
        - Historic districts, lofts, signature skyscrapers, theme park malls
    - Cities:
        - Celebrate diversity
        - Consumer playground

## Aestheticization of Everyday Life
- Post-Modern aestheticization of the everyday
    - Leveling out of symbolic hierarchies
    - Cultural declassification
    - Breaking down the boundary between art and everyday life
    - Collapsing the distinction between high art and mass/pop culture
    - Stylistic promiscuity and playful mixing of codes
    - Embracing the "anti-aesthetic" to resist the market

- Aestheticization of the everyday literally means to **turn the "ordinary" into art**
- It fetishizes the life practices of others so as to hide pre-existing class relations
- However, aestheticization also involves the production of a general set of dispositions around a **classed identity**

## Aestheticization of Consumption
- Breakdown of the boundaries between art and life leading to aestheticization of the everyday
- Beyond the "positional good"; **ability to consumer with "style" = aestheticization**

- Social status in capitalist society:
    - Role in production process
    - Role in consumer markets
    - "Cultural capital"

- Post-Modern consumption:
    - Identity through consumption
    - Demand for multiple niche markets
    - Search for "other" and "authenticity"
    - De-centering of occupational identity; **ones identity is now formed by the things they consumer rather than the labor they do**

## Aestheticization & Urban Regeneration
- Post-Modern period:
    - "An historic compromise between capital & culture"

- Contributing factors:
    - Declining returns on urban fringe
    - Search for new sites of accumulation 
    - Devalued central & inner-city
    - Rise of service economy in central area
- Cultural factors:
    - Revaluing historic & urban
    - From production to consumption in cities
    - New scales of competition among cities

- NYC's SoHo & loft living
    - Deindustrialization (1950-70)
        - Loss of manufacturing jobs (light industry)
        - Banks withdraw from lending to industry
        - Zoning changes for commercial & residential
    - Creation of a "loft lifestyle" (1960-80)
        - Artists' lifestyles profiled in media
        - Artists fought to have access to loft units
        - Middle-class defended "preservation"
        - Middle-class consumers "aestheticized" artists' loft lifestyle
            - Large spaces, authentic, urban, industrial chic

## The Rise of the Symbolic Economy
- Symbolic practices of culture are productive activities that can be monetized
- Culture becomes the economy
- Based in tourism, media, and entertainment (image consumption)
- Cities only have themselves to sell
- Branded spaces, place promotion
- Where one consumes is now as important as what one consumes
- New geographies of the symbolic economy
    - The privatization of the public space
    - The homogenization of diversity

### Early-Modern Urban Consumption (1880-1945)
- Economy: competitive industrialism & commercialized culture
- New urban forms:
    - Department stores, commercial entertainment districts, amusement parks
- Public sociability:
    - Commodification, consumption, and heterogeneity

### Late-Modern Urban Consumption (1945-1975)
- Economy: mass production & mass consumption (Fordism)
- New urban forms:
    - Suburban shopping center, enclosed mall, mega-malls & entertainment-malls
- Public sociability:
    - Private, commercial, and homogeneous

### Post-Modern Urban Consumption (1975+)
- Economy: global capitalism & niche consumption
- New urban forms:
    - Post-Modern architecture, urban regeneration
    - Revitalized shopping streets, ports, latte bars
    - Branded public spaces
    - Consumption cities & urban replicas
- Sociability:
    - Aestheticization of diversity with drive to homogeneity

# Reading Notes: The Cultures of Cities - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 3)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What is culture?
    - Why have the concerns of cultural studies and postcolonial theory becomes so important in the study of cities?
    - What are the roles of space and place in the formation of culture?
    - What is meant by the "postmodern city"?

- **Ethnoscape** = landscape of immigrants, tourists, refugees, exiles, guest workers, and other moving groups to be found in contemporary cities

## 3.1 What is Culture?
- Culture as **"ways of life"**; comprised of:
    1. The values that people hold; their ideals and aspirations
    2. The norms that people follow; the rules and principles that govern their lives
    3. The material objects that people use; Ex: consumer goods, transportation systems, buildings/urban facilities

- Central to culture are shared sets of understandings, often called **discourses/narratives**

- **Semiology** = study of shared meanings
    - **Signifiers** = things that point to these shared meanings
    - **Signified** = the cultural meaning itself
    - **Signifying practices** = activities rich in cultural symbolism

- **Iconography** = the study of meanings behind urban landscapes
    - **Monumental architecture** = large architectural projects full of symbolism; Ex: expensive and imposing business headquarters signifies corporate power

## 3.2 Postcolonial Theory and the City
- **postcolonial theory** = examination of **imperialist discourses** that govern Western representations of non-Western cities and societies
    - Attempts to undermine **ethnocentrism** (notion that Western thought is superior)

- **Subaltern classes** = those subjected to Western hegemony; those who are having Western discourses imposed on them

- **Hybridity** = idea that all cultures are **mixtures** of other culture, also meaning that there no single "authentic" culture for a particular place; culture as always mixing and changing as it interacts with other cultures

## 3.3 Space, Power, and Culture
- Crucial role of **space** in the formation of culture, and the fact that "space" itself is **socially constructed**

- Some people are **excluded** from public spaces (homeless, mentally ill, drunks, etc.), representing the fact that there are power dynamics taking place within space that govern who does and doesn't "belong"
    - Spaces reinforce culture because certain patterns of behavior (norms) are expected within them, reflecting certain cultural values held within space

- Power (within space) is expressed through the monopolization of space by some groups, and the exclusion of certain weaker groups
    - These power relations are taken for granted/naturalized as a part of everyday life, leading to **cultural imperialism**; dominant power relations become "invisible" while excluded groups are marked as "other"
## 3.4 Postmodernism
- **Modernism** = school of thought that uses rational thought to determine universal patterns/generalities that govern space
- **Postmodernism** = rejection of the idea that there are universal patterns
    - Recognizes the diversity and uniqueness of different groups, that there is no one "pure, immediate, undistilled experience"

## Chapter Summary
- 3.1: Cities play a crucial role in the formation of cultures; These cultures involve **‘ways of life’** including the values that people hold, the norms that they follow, and the material objects that they use
- 3.2: All cultures are **hybrid mixtures of various influences** that change over time and so the notion that there is some pure authentic culture is a myth
- 3.3: Space plays a crucial role in the evolution of cultural values since, like culture, it is a social construct intimately bound up with power and authority
- 3.4: Although postmodernism is a much disputed concept, many of the recent changes in cities such as the focus upon **consumption** and **growing fragmentation and diversity** can be interpreted as a manifestation of the postmodern condition
