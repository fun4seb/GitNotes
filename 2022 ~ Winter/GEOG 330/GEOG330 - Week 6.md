# GEOG330 - Week 6: Cities of Difference

# Lecture Notes: Cities of Difference
- **The city as a "mosaic"**
    - Cities sustain radically diverse "ways of life"
    - Framed as fixed and bounded "social worlds"
        - Bounded territories
        - Fixed singular identities
        - Characterized by "difference" from norm
    - Neighbors in space but worlds apart
        - Coexistence in space
        - Adjacent tiles of difference
        - Pronounced juxtapositions
        - Produces interaction with multiple social worlds

- Cities understood as a collection of neighborhoods defined by:
    - Morphology
    - Land use
    - Social class
    - Ethnic origins, religion, and "race"
    - Lifestyle, stage in life cycle
- How do these factors shape the structure of cities?

## Robert Park's idea of 'The City' (1915)
- Social worlds
    - Formed through sorting out of different moral regions
    - Creates a **mosaic pattern**
- Urban 'ecology'
    - Drew ideas from **plant ecology**
    - Based in competition for habitat
    - Dominance, symbiosis, succession
        - **Symbiosis** = interaction is mutually beneficial
- Competition
    - Strongest inhabitants out-compete for advantageous location
    - Expand and force others to relocate in outward succession

## The Burgess Model (1924)
- The city is a **"social organism"** in which:
    - People interact
    - Struggle to survive
    - Sort themselves out into group areas
- Follows principles of "natural selection"
    - Competition, invasion, dominance, succession

- Each little world is an "ecological unit"

## Urban Morphology
- Study of the physical qualities of the urban environment; how cities are laid out, shape of city block structure, etc.
    - Dominant forms: **rectangular & curvilinear**

- Urban morphological regions
    - Regional geographies of:
        - Lot size & shape
        - Building types
    - Shaped by:
        - Location relative to CBD
        - Land use
        - Transportation development
        - Ideology
        - Social factors

- **Morphogenesis** = the processes that create & shape the physical fabric of cities
    - Each successive phase brings new forces:
        - Aesthetic ideals, power, social norms
    - General patterns:
        - Central area:
            - Dynamic & constantly changing
            - Mixed land uses
        - Outer areas:
            - Stable and clearly defined

## Urban Land Use
- Categories of land use:
    - **Residential**
        - 40% of developed land
        - Shaped by other land uses, elites draw in middle classes
    - **Transportation**
        - 20% of developed land
        - Shapes accessibility to and between other land uses
    - **Commercial**
        - Can pay the highest values for a central location
        - Highest order in CBD, lower follows residents
    - **Industrial**
        - Second highest bidder, follows transport and land costs
        - Found in CBD & in suburban industrial parks
    - **Public**
        - Private & government-owned publicly accessible lands
        - Static effect; adds value but cannot move

- Determining factors of land use:
    - Activity
    - Proximity to CBD
    - Land values
    - Zoning
    - Competition among users
    - Transportation routes
    - Transportation costs
    - Topography

- Competition among land uses shapes patterns
    - Commercial: can always pay highest price to be near market
    - Residential: must be high density to occupy center
    - Industrial: cannot compete in CBD but needs to be near center

### Bid-Rent Curve
- Location of a land use depends on **trade-offs** between:
    - Transportation costs
    - Access to market
    - Land costs

- Each activity is determined by a different trade-off
    - **Commerce:** most central location; most expensive rent
    - **Industrial:** large space near workers, rail & port access
    - **Elite residence:** large space, high transportation costs
    - **Working-class residence:** cheap housing near work; least expensive rent

## Descriptive Models of Land Use
- **Concentric Zone Model (Burgess, 1925)** = Concentric circles radiate from CBD
    - Five circular zones
    - City grows through invasion & succession
    - Class of residents increases away from CBD
    - Density of commerce increases toward CBD
    - Industry in Zone II (transition zone)

- **Sector Model (Homer Hoyt, 1939)** = Sectors radiate out from CBD
    - As city grows land uses grow & extend outwards in sectors
    - Growth most rapid along transport lines
    - Industry grows along major routes (route & rail)
    - Industry:
        - Attracts low income residents (for work)
        - Repels high income residents (pollution, poverty, etc.)
    - Middle class follows high income residents 

- **Multiple Nuclei Model (Harris and Ullman, 1945)** = Patchwork pattern with multiple nodes
    - Patchwork pattern around one CBD & few secondary "nodes"
    - Land use is sorted based on:
        - Clustering around transportation lines
        - Attraction of complimentary activities
        - Repelling activities that are incompatible
        - Ability to pay for desired sites
        - Established uses (historic core)
    - New features:
        - Class of industrial land use
        - Industrial suburbs
        - Suburban downtowns

## Factorial Ecology
- Factorial ecology is used to measure major dimensions of "differentiation"
    - Multiple factors interact to create "social areas"

- Three composite factors:
    - Socio-economic status
        - Income, education, occupation
    - Family status
        - Stage in life cycle, marital status
    - Ethnic status
        - "Race", ethnic origins, religion, place of birth

- Hoyt's 1939 study of income sectors:
    - Hoyt found that high income groups move out of the center creating sectors that radiate outwards from the center
    - High income (rent) areas in Seattle in 1900 initiated the path to higher income suburbs in 1915 and 1936

- **Patterns of factorial analysis:**
    - **Economic status** (sectoral)
        - Elite distances from lower classes
        - Middle class follows elites
        - Sectors radiate from older districts
    - **Family status** (concentric)
        - Increases with distance from CBD
        - Based on land value, density, and "ideals"
    - **Ethnic status** (clusters & bands)
        - Stem from established areas
        - New immigrants replace established

- **Uses of factorial ecology:**
    - Studies of social structure
    - Marketing
    - Segregation (DIS; index of dissimilarity)
        - Immigration
        - Racialization
        - Poverty
    - Deprivation & quality of life
        - Deprivation: composite measures of disadvantage by CT
        - Quality of life: index scores of social & environmental well-being by CT

# Reading Notes: Patterns of Sociospatial Differentiation - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 4)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What are the main patterns displayed by the physical structure of cities?
    - What are the main processes that create and reshape the urban fabric?
    - What are the main socio-economic dimensions of city structure and how are they manifest geographically?
    - What are the main differences in the quality of life in cities?

## 4.1 Urban Morphology and the Physical Structure of Cities

## 4.2 Difference and Inequality: Socio-economic and Sociocultural Patterns

## Chapter Summary
- 4.1: The physical structures of cities display complex patterns that reflect many processes superimposed over the years. There are wide variations in environmental quality in cities. Urban areas also have distinctive characteristics that can often best be captured through subjective written descriptions that reflect the ‘feel’ of a neighbourhood
- 4.2: Studies of Western cities reveal interrelationships between groups of variables reflecting three main dimensions: economic inequalities, family status and ethnicity, which are often reflected respectively in sectors, concentric rings and clusters. There are, however, many variations in residential structure reflecting the distinctive processes to be found within cities. Territorial social indicators also reveal wide variations in the quality of life in cities. Often these indices overlap to reveal multiple deprivation

# Reading Notes: From Chicago to L.A. and back again - Shearmur & Charron
> This article was among the critiques of Postmodern urbanism used in Assignment 1. For this section of the course it also provides and excellent illustration of social area analysis applied to a Montreal case study. It is therefore very useful for Assignment 2 because it provides a discussion of the urban geographies of social rank, family status and ethnicity and applies them to Montreal's CMA

# Reading Notes: Divisions and disparities in Lotus-Land File - Ley & Lynch
> In this research report, Ley and Lynch use census data to examine the growing inequality and income polarization in the Vancouver Metropolitan Area since 1970 leading to what they describe as "three cities", polarized neighbourhood configurations wherein deprivation is also linked to immigrant and ethnic status. It provides an excellent illustration of how social area analysis can be used to draw attention to spatial inequalities. Please skim it and have a good idea of their major arguments and the contours of the three cities they propose
