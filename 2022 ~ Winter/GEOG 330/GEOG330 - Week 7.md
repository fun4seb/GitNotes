# GEOG330 - Week 7: Rights to the City

# Lecture Notes: Rights to the City

## Cities & Citizenship
- **Citizenship** = relationship between individuals and the community determined by civil status

- Urban citizenship & society:
    - Ancient Greek urban empire
    - Medieval European cities
    - Industrial capitalism and nationhood

- Modern citizenship:
    - Locational (nation-state boundaries)
    - Constructed through political, social, and civil, rights
    - Located in the **"public sphere"**

## The Public Sphere
- The structural transformation of the public sphere (Jurgen Habermas)
    - **Deliberative democracy (Ancient Greece):**
        - The exchange of information and views on questions of common concern can take place so that public opinion can be formed
    - **Representative publicity (Feudal society):**
        - The royalty and aristocracy represented their lordship not for but “before” the people
    - **Bourgeois public sphere (18th century nation states):**
        - Public realm between society and new state
        - White male property owners represented their individual private interests
    - **Structural decline & re-feudalization (industrial capitalism):**
        - Commercialization of media permits the wealthy to influence the masses, ‘the tyranny of the majority’ and ‘irrationality’

- **The rise of the public sphere:**
    - Rise of merchant capitalism
    - Declining role of the church
    - Creation of "public property"
    - Expansion of the bourgeoisie class
    - Development of the first nation-states
    - "Free" individuals in civil society
    - Represent "private" family units
    - Constitute "the public" interests
    - "Public opinion" shaped through public exchange of private citizens
    - New institutions between the economy and the state (newspaper, salons, coffee shops, debating societies)
    - Emergence of a universal and rational "public sphere"

> The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of commodity exchange and social labor. (Habermas, 1964, 27)

- Nancy Fraser's critique of Habermas' public sphere
    - **Unequal access:**
        - Based on property ownership, nuclear family
        - Explicit discrimination against racialized "others"
        - "Public man", "private woman" dichotomy
    - **Private interests:**
        - Individuals act in their own private interest
        - Private interests do not represent “common good”
    - **Universalism:**
        - There is no single overarching, unified "public"
        - Cannot bracket “difference” and power relations
        - Subaltern counter publics bring change

## Harvey and The Right to the City
> The creation of a new urban commons, a public sphere of active democratic participation, requires that we roll back that huge wave of privatization that has been the mantra of a destructive "Neo-liberalism" ... If our urban world has been imagined and made then it can be re-imagined and re-made. The inalienable right to the city is worth fighting for. "City air makes one free" is used to be said. The air is a bit polluted now. But it can always be cleaned up - Harvey, D. (2003). The right to the city. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 27(4), 939-941

- Idea that privatization halts the progress and creation of a new urban commons; this new urban commons is centered around the importance of a public sphere of active democratic participation
- Idea that we have the ability to mold and change the spaces within our cities with enough public support

> The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities are ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights - Harvey, D. (2008). The right to the city. New Left Review, 53, 23-40

- The "right to the city" means to have the right to impact and change ones surroundings
- This ability and "right" to change the city is dependent upon the collective power of those in the public sphere

## Situationist International
- Situationist International, 1957-1972
    - A group of artists and writers working to negate modern society and its complete incorporation by the spectacle by rejecting passivity and doubt and politicizing aesthetics and influenced the social movements stemming from May 1968

- **Guy Debord**
    - Media and consumption create an artificial reality
    - Living in the society of the "spectacle" hides everyday life
    - Methods for escaping the "spectacle"
        - La derive (drift)
        - Le detournement (disruption)
    - Psychogeographie
        - Deepening the emphasis on the relationship between the urban environment on the emotions and behavior of individuals

- Guy Debord's Guide Psychogeographie de Paris, 1957
    - Debord's map of Paris demonstrates the power of the drift (derive) to reconnect fragments of the city and disrupt (detourner) routinized movement
    - "The arrows represent slopes that naturally connect different ambient units; that is, spontaneous patterns in the orientation of a subject who is moving through this environment without taking into account the practical sequences, for work or distraction, that usually condition his conduct"
    - The movements of the drifter, guided by the action of the geographical environment and its "affectivity", are thus traced, leading to psychogeographic reconstruction of urban space. Its "passions" space that has become "available", a labyrinth contingently inscribed in time and understood through the experience

- Urban politics of Situationist International
    - **Consumption:**
        - Cities should not be used to stimulate consumption
    - **Housing**
        - Public housing should not be displaced by market values
        - Popular classes have right to center
    - **Access to urban space:**
        - Use value should trump exchange value
        - Inhabitance is a form of citizenship
    - **La Derive (drift):**
        - Cities are not only for production and consumption
        - Ability to aimlessly walk without an objective

## Lefebvre's Right to the City
> The right to the city "... should modify, concretize and make more practical the rights of the citizen as an urban dweller (citadin) and user of multiple services. It would affirm, on the one hand, the right of users to make known their ideas on the space and time of their activities in the urban area; it would also cover the right to the use of the center, a privileged space, instead of being dispersed and stuck in ghettos (for workers, immigrants, the "marginal" and even for the "privileged)" - Henri Lefebvre (1991). The production of space. Blackwell, Oxford

- Lefebvre's idea of a **citadin** = citizen (national) fused with inhabitant (urban)

- Key points of Lefebvre's "Right to the City"
    - City (capitalist commodification of space) and urban (everyday)
    - Capitalism carves up the space of the city to advance itself
    - Right to the city is a process to de-alienate the spaces of the city by knitting them back together
    - "Rights" to city space conferred by inhabitance (dwelling) not property ownership
    - Right to centrality, not to be peripheralized due to urban redevelopment

- Lefebvre's rights of citadins to the city:
    - **Appropriation:**
        - Taking back what has been expropriated by capitalism
        - Citadins reorient space through everyday use
    - **Encounter:**
        - Engage together about the meaning of space
        - Citadins reconnect with each other through networks
    - **Participation:**
        - Be involved in spatial decision-making
        - Citadins become aware of themselves as inhabitants
    - **Autogestion:**
        - Refuse authority and practice self-management
        - Citadins realize and take back their collective power

## De Jure Urban Spaces
- Geographical areas enshrined by law

- Scales:
    - Central city governments
    - Suburban municipalities
    - Inter-municipal regional bodies
    - Metropolitan agencies
- Practices:
    - Incorporation
    - Annexation
    - Suburban incorporation
    - Municipal fragmentation

## Urban Governance
- **Urban government** = institutions of government
- **Urban governance** = powers outside of formal government
    - Formal authorities: elected & professional
    - Civil society: citizens groups, unions
    - Private sector: chambers of commerce

- Governance as "process"
    - Involves diverse competing interests
    - Developed in relation to mode of production

- Interpreting the role of the Local State
    - **Structuralist:**
        - Urban governments act in the interests of capital accumulation & reproduction
    - **Industrialist:**
        - Local state is a tool of the business elite
    - **Managerialist:**
        - Urban governments act in the interests of their officials (values, goals, etc.)
    - **Regulationist:**
        - Successive regimes of accumulation institute specific forms of regulation

- **Evolution of urban governance:**
    1. Laissez-Faire Mercantile City (1790-1840)
    2. Municipal Socialism & Machine Politics (1840-1875)
    3. Boosterism & Reform Politics (1875-1920)
    4. Fragmentation & Growth Coalitions (1920-1945)
    5. The City as Growth Machine (1945-1973)
    6. The Entrepreneurial City (1973+)

### Laissez-Faire Mercantile City (1790-1840)
- Regime: competitive mercantilism
- Regulation: utilitarianism
    - Laissez-Faire philosophy: maximum public benefit will come from market forces
    - Governed by merchants, patricians, and land owners from "established families"
- Urban governance:
    - Non-professional, weak, disorganized
    - Non-interventionist
    - Provide essential local services (roads, sanitation, law)

### Municipal Socialism & Machine Politics (1840-1875)
- Regime: early industrial capitalism
- Regulation: collective consumption
    - Municipal socialism: local government intervenes to ensure key services & amenities
    - Paternalism: elites are responsible for reforming the "ills" of the city for the working class
- Urban governance:
    - Urban problems = increased scope and scale
    - **Machine politics:** corrupt & controlling leaders depending on working-class support

- **Machine politics:**
    - New group of self-made entrepreneurs: merchants, manufacturers, building contractors, real estate speculators
    - Political objectives:
        - Compete for public control to expand public policy in their own interests
        - Create parties that represent these interests
        - Overcome unrest by working with unions
    - Machines of patronage:
        - Brokers of competing political interests
        - Deliver services in exchange for benefits

### Boosterism & Reform Politics (1875-1920)
- Regime: large scale industrialism
- Regulation: promote growth while restoring order
    - **Boosterism:** government facilities and activities to attract investors due to high competition
    - Reform: suburban middle class demands "progressive" government
- Urban governance:
    - Annexation & incorporation of middle class
    - Focus on aggregate economic benefits
    - Reform & service provision

- **Reform in the progressive era:**
    - Middle-class responses to the "ills" of the city
    - Formed "leagues" to solve urban problems:
        - Religious & moral: temperance, exploitation, "vice"
        - Educational: school attendance = good citizens
        - Sanitary: physical conditions to improve moral & social
        - Political: democratic voting rights unravels corruption

### Fragmentation & The Growth Coalition (1920-1945)
- Regime: decentered late industrialism
- Regulation: competitive pro-growth coalitions
    - Metropolitan fragmentation: suburbs fight annexation through incorporation
    - Growth coalitions: labor and reform band together to stimulate urban growth
- Urban governance:
    - Coalition building in the "city's" interest
    - Professionalization of services

- **Process of metropolitan fragmentation:**
    1. Middle-class suburbanization
    2. Suburban municipal incorporation
    3. Suburban political autonomy
    4. “Fiscal squeeze” (low tax base with increased demand)
    5. Entrenched socio-spatial segregation
    6. Suburban zoning and privatization
    7. Middle class retreat from urban issues
    8. Fragmentation of metropolitan life

### The City as a Growth Machine & Services (1945-1973)
- Regime: post-WWII mass consumption
- Regulation: municipal services & renewal
    - Keynesian management: federal governments involved in urban development
    - Cities as service providers: housing, etc.
    - Growth machine: coalition of interests that seek federal & private capital
- Urban governance:
    - Professional party politicians
    - Response to urban social movements
    - Public service provision

### Entrepreneurialism & Fiscal Crisis (1973+)
- Regime: economic restructuring & deindustrialization
- Regulation: neo-liberalism
    - Fiscal crisis: Fiscal squeeze creates decline in tax revenues & funding
    - Entrepreneurial, global competition
    - Privatization (services & development)
- Urban government:
    - Public-private partnerships
    - Political disenfranchisement
    - Deal-making ethos in urban planning

- **Entrepreneurial strategies:**
    - Maintain attractiveness for production
        - Maintain infrastructure
        - Provide customized corporate inducements
    - Capitalize on federal expenditures
        - Funding priorities, public sector as stimulant
    - Capital command & control functions
        - Public provision of communications, airports
        - Private provision of offices, hotels, etc.
    - Improve attractiveness for consumption
        - Increase ‘quality of life’ to attract service investment

## Image Politics of Cities: Place Promotion
- **Place promotion** = using branding to "reinvent" a city with new qualities

- Former industrial cities: clean & green
- Small emerging cities: centrality & labor
- Large global cities: quality of life

- Examples of image politics in American cities:
    - The future: "New Brunswick for Tomorrow"
    - Center: "Put your business at the center of the world" (Atlanta, GE)
    - Gateway: "Your gateway to Mexico" (Brownsville, TX)
    - Cheap: "Consider the less taxing environment" (Orlando, FL)
    - Labor: "Emporia: Working for You"
    - Quality of life: "A livable place to work" (Santa Maria, CA)

- Common in image politics and place promotion of cities is the updating of city logos to aid in the reinvention of a city's identity
    - Ex: Syracuse, NY logo change; removal of industrial symbolism

# Reading Notes: Spatial and institutional frameworks; citizens, the state and civil society - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 5)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - In what ways are the structures of cities influenced by legal, governmental and political structures?
    - What are the consequences of metropolitan fragmentation?
    - In what ways does the institutional structure of cities affect the functioning of democracy?
    - How is power distributed in cities?

## 5.1: The Interdependence of Public Institutions and Private life

## 5.2: De Jure Urban Spaces

## 5.3: The Democratic Base and its Spatial Framework

## 5.4: Community Power Structures and the Role of the Local State

## 5.5: The Question of Social Justice in the City

## Chapter Summary
- 5.1: The processes at work in cities have both shaped, and been shaped by, institutional frameworks. The law is a crucial link between the public and private spheres of city life. The changing economic base of urban areas has important implications for city life
- 5.1: The fragmentation of cities into multiple political and administrative jurisdictions is justified in the interests of local democracy but often leads to considerable inequalities in resource allocation
- 5.3: The functioning of local democracy is influenced by electoral frameworks, elected officials and city bureaucrats, as well as in the parapolitical structure of informal groups focused around residents, organized labor, and various business interests
- 5.4: Who has most power to effectively control cities is a question that has produced numerous theories, principally: the pluralist, managerialist, instrumentalist and structural interpretations. Regulation theory is seen by some as a way of overcoming the limitations of these previous theories
- 5.5: The functioning of institutional frameworks in mediating the activities of citizens and the state raises crucial issues of social and territorial justice
# Reading Notes: Right to the City - Harvey
> This very short text by geographer David Harvey provides an excellent overview of the idea of the "right to the city" stemming from the work of Henri Lefebvre and The Situationist International

- One's "right to the city" = a right to change it
    - We must be able to, and have the "right" to, remake our cities and urban societies

- How can we better exercise this right to the city? (right to remake the city)

- "We individually and collectively make the city through our daily actions and our political, intellectual, and economic engagements (with the city)"
    - In return the city makes us; dialectic of making the city through our actions and being made by the city in turn

- But was is social "justice"?
    - Thrasymachus in Plato's Republic argues that each form of government enacts 'the laws with a view to its own advantage' so that 'the just is the same everywhere, the advantage of the stronger';  Plato rejected this in favor of justice as an **ideal**
    - A plethora of justice "ideals" now exist:
        - We could be egalitarian, utilitarian in the manner of Bentham (the greatest good of the greatest number) 
        - contractual in the manner of Rousseau (with his ideals of inalienable rights) or John Rawls
        - cosmopolitan in the manner of Kant (a wrong to one is a wrong to all)
        - Just plain Hobbesian, insisting that the state (Leviathan) impose justice upon reckless private interests to prevent social life being violent, brutal and short
        - Some even argue for local ideals of justice, sensitive to cultural differences
    - In practice, we suspect Thrasymachus was right: **justice is simply whatever the ruling class wants it to be**

- All ideals about rights hide suppositions about social processes. Conversely, social processes incorporate certain conceptions of rights. To challenge those rights is to challenge the social process and vice versa
    - We live in a society in which the inalienable rights to private property and the profit rate trump any other conception of inalienable rights you can think of
    - This is because our society is dominated by the accumulation of capital through market exchange

- To live under capitalism is to accept or submit to that bundle of rights necessary for endless capital accumulation

- Free markets are not necessarily fair; "There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals"
    - This is what the market does. The rich grow richer and the poor get poorer through the egalitarianism of exchange; No wonder those of wealth and power support such rights
    - Market freedoms inevitably produce monopoly power (as in the media or among developers). Thirty years of neoliberalism teaches us that the freer the market the greater the inequalities and the greater the monopoly power

- The right to the city is not merely a right of access to what the property speculators and state planners define, but an **active right to make the city different, to shape it more in accord with our heart's desire, and to re-make ourselves thereby in a different image**
    - The creation of a new urban commons, a public sphere of active democratic participation, requires that we roll back that huge wave of privatization that has been the mantra of a destructive neoliberalism

# Reading Notes: From Managerialism to Entrepreneurialism - Harvey
> This classic text by David Harvey examines the shift in urban governance away from managerial service provision and towards urban entrepreneurialism in a world of inter-urban competition

- "To unravel the role of urbanization in social change", particularly in the context of capitalism

- Capitalism is the force behind **social change**, and the individual may struggle to effect this social change; The capitalists find themselves ‘dominated and constrained by their own creations’ (speaking in **dialectical** terms)
    - It is from such a standpoint that I seek more powerful insights into that **process of city making** that is both product and condition of ongoing social processes of **transformation** in the most recent phase of capitalist development’

## The shift to entrepreneurialism in urban governance
- "Taken place these last two decades in the advanced capitalist countries… the "managerial" approach so typical of the 1960s has steadily given way to initiatory and "entrepreneurial" forms of action in the 1970's and 1980's"
    - New role of local government supporting this

- "There is general agreement, of course, that the shift has something to do with the difficulties that have beset capitalist economies since the recession of 1973"
    - **Deindustrialization, widespread and seemingly 'structural' unemployment, fiscal austerity** at both the national and local levels, all coupled with a rising tide of neo-conservatism and much stronger appeal (though often more in theory than in practice) to market rationality and privatization,provide a backdrop to understanding why so many urban governments, often of quite different political persuasions and armed with very different legal and political powers, have all taken a broadly similar direction’

- Harvey argues that the **transformation of urban governance** (managerial to entrepreneurial) these last two decades has its roots in, and implications of, **macro-economics**
    - If ‘the city is the relevant unit for understanding how the wealth of nations is created, then the shift from urban managerialism to urban entrepreneurialism could have far reaching implications for future growth prospects’

## Conceptual issues
- The reification of cities
    - **Reification** = the making of social relations into ‘things’ in an impersonal manner
    - "it makes it seem as if 'cities' can be **active agents** when they are mere things"
        - The cities themselves are not active but are made to feel so (made to be more than mere things) by the **spatially bound, social processes of the people which inhabit them**

- "Spatial practices"
    - "In a class-bound society such as capitalism, these spatial practices acquire a definite class content"; **certain areas become the spaces of a certain class** (Ex: In Paris where the poor are pushed to the periphery and the rich move into the center; periphery = poor, center = rich)

- Three things to consider which arise out of urbanization:
    1. Urbanization as ‘the spatially grounded set of social processes’ and this urbanization produces artifacts and then many social processes become channeled by them (Ex: commuting)
    2. Urbanization also leads to bureaucratic forms which too effect daily practices and actions
    3. **the consciousness of urban inhabitants is affected by the environment of experience out of which perceptions, symbolic readings, and aspiration arise**

- The city/urban under capitalism as always changing and ‘unstable’
    - This conception of urbanism reflects the ‘dynamism’ of capitalism, therefore urbanism has itself to reflect changing relations between form and process, between activity and thing, between subjects and object
    - "Any firm definition of the urban as a distinctive spatial domain is problematic" as conceptions of the "urban" are always changing

- ‘The shift towards entrepreneurialism in urban governance has to be examined, then, at a variety of spatial scales: local neighborhood and community, central city and suburb, metropolitan region, region, nation state, etc.

## Three broad assertions (about urban entrepreneurialism)
1. The new entrepreneurialism has, as its centerpiece, the notion of a ‘public-private partnership in which a traditional local boosterism is integrated with the use of local governmental powers to try and attract external sources of funding, new direct investments, or new employment sources
2. The activity of that public-private partnership is entrepreneurial precisely because it is **speculative** in execution and design and therefore dogged by all the difficulties and dangers which attach to speculative as opposed to rationally planned and coordinated development 
3. Entrepreneurialism projects focus much more closely on the political economy of **place** rather than of **territory**
    - Territory = ‘economic projects (housing, education, etc.) that are designed primarily to improve conditions of living or working within a particular jurisdiction; **administrative area/boundary**
    - Place = The construction of place (a new civic center, an industrial park) or the enhancement of conditions within a place (Ex: intervention in local labour markets by re-training schemes or downward pressure on local wages), on the other hand, can have impacts either smaller or greater than the specific territory within which such projects happen to be located; **area/space with an identity that can be changed and improved**

## Alternative strategies for urban governance
- Four basic options for urban entrepreneurialism:
    1. Competition within the international division of labour means the creation, and then exploitation, of particular advantages for the production of goods and services
    2. The urban region can also seek to improve its competitive position with respect to the spatial division of consumption
        - Increased consumerism sine 1950 leading to mass consumption and urban redevelopment
    3. Urban entrepreneurialism has also been strongly colored by a fierce struggle over the acquisition of key control and command functions in high finance, government, or information gathering and processing (including the media)
    4. Competitive edge with respect to redistributions of surpluses through central governments

- In short, the task of urban governance is to lure highly mobile and flexible production, financial, and consumption flows into its space

## The macro-economic implications of inter-urban competition
- Urban entrepreneurialism encourages the development of those kinds of activities and endeavors that have the **strongest localized capacity to enhance property values, the tax base, the local circulation of revenues, and (most importantly/hoped-for) employment growth**
    - Development of urban spaces, makes them attractive, brings in people, jobs, economic growth, etc.

- "Part of what we have seen these last two decades is the attempt to build a physical and social imagery of cities suited for that competitive purpose" (capitalism)
    - Restructuring the identity of a city in a way that best accommodates for capitalism to function

## Critical perspectives on the entrepreneurial turn in urban governance under conditions of inter-urban competition
- Importance of local autonomy  
- Capitalism as speculative
- "a radical reconstruction of central to local state relations and the cutting free of local state activities from the welfare state and the Keynesian compromise (both of which have been under strong at tack these last two decades)"
