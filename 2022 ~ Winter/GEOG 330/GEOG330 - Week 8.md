# GEOG330 - Week 8: Building the City

# Lecture Notes: Building the City

## The Contradictions of Housing
- Housing was historically owner-built, but speculative house building emerged with industrialization transforming housing into a **commodity with an exchange value**
- Housing has both a use value and exchange value
    - **Use value:** shelter, privacy, a world of effective relations with people. the place from which we engage the world
    - **Exchange value:** an asset, a form of stored wealth, a commodity subject to market speculation, more recently an object of speculative gain (house flipping), something to financialized
- Housing is a long-term material investment that is "fixed" in space
    - It is subject to the building cycle of 70 years
    - Its value is shaped by cycle of  capital moving through the urban land market
    - Its value is also locally shaped by externalities, by its surroundings (rich vs. poor areas)
- Therefor, housing has become **highly political**
    - Owners and coalitions leverage urban institutions to protect housing assets
    - Desire to protect assets leads to NIMBYism (not in my back yard) and segregation

## Meanings of Housing
- **Shelter and privacy:** housing provides a setting for individual and family life outside the realm of work
- **Status and privilege:** housing is an expression of our social status, a sign of achievement, arrival, upward mobility, and prestige
- **A physical and social environment:** housing is embedded in environments that provide advantages and disadvantages (yards, low or high densities, neighbors)
- **Accessibility to broader urban landscape:** housing is located within an urban landscape offering or limiting access to employment opportunities, schools, shopping districts, and other amenities
- **Source of stored financial wealth:** housing provides the opportunity for home owners to generate equity value, an unearned financial return produced by a long-term, tax-free investment

## 20th Century Housing Market Trends
- Growth of homeownership
    - Post-WWII subsidies
    - Increase cost of housing for lower classes
    - New and denser house forms
- Decline in private renting
    - Smaller rental markets since WWII
    - Rent controls and disinvestment
    - Low quality inner-city private rental shock
- Expansion and decline of public housing
    - Slum clearance programs
    - Housing shortages in post-WWII era
    - Public disinvestment in public housing

## Localized Housing Submarkets
- Housing type: single family, duplex, high-rise
- Household type: family, singles, empty-nesters
- Location: suburbs, inner-city, elite districts
- Tenure: Owner-occupied, private rental, public
- Housing stock: age, size, state of repair

## Modal Age of Dwellings
- The age of the housing stock is typically highest in the central area and lowest on the urban fringe where new development has historically taken place
- With urban redevelopment there is some inversion in this model and some pockets of older housing with varying values

## Homeowners and Renters
- The tenure of housing also follows the concentric pattern with higher concentrations of renters found in high density central areas
- However, inner-city housing is increasingly owner-occupied, displacing renters to the inner suburbs

- Historically, the newest immigrants have been concentrated in rental markets in the central city
    - In Toronto, there are suburban pockets of new immigrant home owners (possibly because the periphery of Toronto is so much cheaper, even renting is getting incredibly expensive)

## The City's Three Rings
1. Central city (pre-1945)
    - Rising homeowner incomes
    - Private rental sector with higher and rising incomes
    - Polarized between middle-class tenants and social housing
2. Inner suburbs (1946-1970)
    - Offers the main lower-cost housing options
    - These are mixed, not deprived areas, but with rising disparities
    - Residents move upward and outward, area moves downward
3. Outer suburbs (post-1980)
    - Broad mix of middle and upper incomes (90 percent of growth)
    - Fast growth = increase in all income levels and household types
    - Homeowners are dominant and the rental sector shrinks each year

## Neighborhood Change
- Aging and physical deterioration of the built environment
    - The quality and consistency of physical maintenance of the housing stock and public infrastructure in 100 year (sometimes 50 or 60 year) cycles
- Flows of investment and disinvestment
    - Developer and real estate investment in one part of the city means disinvestment in others indicated by housing value estimates
- Household mobility
    - Whether or not residents gain access to the capital generated through labor, mortgage lending, rental agreements to move
- Place-based characteristics of neighborhoods
    - Whether the neighborhood is "deteriorating" or "improving" driving households to stay or move

## Neighborhood Life Cycles
- Development
    - Construction of new upscale houses for higher-income households according to a uniform initial plan
- In-filling
    - Construction of multifamily rental complexes increases density and reduces the upper-class exclusivity of the neighborhood
- Downgrading
    - Long-term ageing of houses and people encourages higher-income households to move out, and lower-income households to move in
- Thinning out
    - Accelerated decline and deterioration, followed by rapid turnover, and the demolition of the oldest housing
- Renewal and redevelopment
    - After a period of severe decline, reinvestment begins a new life cycle for the neighborhood

## Vacancy Chains
- New upscale construction on the urban fringe lures wealthy households to move out, creating a vacancy that is then filled by an upper-middle income mover
- Households move out, while vacancy chains move in the opposite direction
- Vacancy chains suggest a "trickle-down" view of the housing market

## Up and Down Filtering
- Housing filters like a downward-moving escalator: new houses at the top lure higher-income households, creating spaces for households father on down to take a step up
- At the bottom, in the central area, housing in abandoned areas filters down until it is abandoned and later demolished

## Housing Submarkets Constraints
- Supply
    - Limited availability of certain types of housing that cannot be reproduced (heritage homes, affordable large rental apartments)
- Accessibility
    - Houses have unique locations that can either confer value or detract from their value
- Neighborhood
    - Particular small areas can be in demand (restricts supple, increases housing costs) or experience disinvestment (ample supply, lower housing costs)
- Institutional
    - Mortgage lenders, insurers, building codes, zoning, regulations
- Discrimination
    - Households experience discrimination due to race, religion, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and gender
- Information
    - Households have different access to information on housing opportunities and housing markets

## Key Actors in the Housing Market
- Governments
- Landowners & speculators
- Developers & builders
- Urban designers, planners, architects
- Mortgage financiers, insurers, etc.
- Real estate agents
- Public housing Managers

### Landowners
- Determine:
    - When, where, and what new development
    - Determine quality of housing stock
    - Key actors in morphogenesis
- Types of landowners:
    - Land-endowed elite (covenants on use)
    - Public (government)
    - Industrial (farmers on the fringe)
    - Financial & speculative (investors)
    - Landlords (small-scale rental units)
    - Homeowners (range of tenures)

### Speculators
- Seek low-priced land before it appreciates and sell at peak value
- Three types:
    1. Serendipitous
        - Land holders who purchase property but then discover value for another purpose
    2. Active
        - Buy and sell land anticipating profit
        - Small scale, individual
    3. Structural
        - Large scale investors
        - Seek to influence decision-making to benefit

### Developers & Builders
- Agents in housing provision who act in interest of responding to market demand
- Low cost, high profits, high turn-around
- They influence:
    - Location through site selection
        - Seek assembled land appropriate for market
    - Physical character
        - Architecture and design for markets
    - Social characters
        - Housing types and markets by neighborhood

### Design Professions
- Translate dominant societal values into material form
- Societal norms regarding:
    - Private property
    - Family structure
    - Gender norms
    - Aesthetics
    - Ideals

### Mortgage Financiers
- Decide who can buy homes and where
- Highest returns with lowest risk
- Influence increases with homeownership
- Use both **spatial and social discrimination**

### Real Estate Agents
- Reinforce neighborhood patterns
- Motivations:
    - High turn-over and high prices
    - Optimal market conditions
        - Finding the "right" households for a neighborhood
        - Maintaining a marketable neighborhoods
        - Keeping neighborhood customers
- Shape:
    - Composition of neighborhoods
    - Neighborhood land values

- **Block-Busting**
    - Real-estate agents use racist rears to speculate in declining housing markets
    - History:
        - Pre-WWII: racially restrictive covenants
        - 1948: Equal Protection Clause, desegregation; being to "block-bust"
        - 1968: Fair Housing Act: discrimination outlawed
    - Process:
        - Encourage residents to sell: "neighborhood is changing"
        - Buy the properties and hold for speculation
        - Sell to minority groups at higher prices

### Public Housing Managers
- Use private market values to allocate
- Allocate public units based on "need":
    - Family status
    - Family size
    - Age & health
    - Displacement by slum clearance
- Localization of households
    - "Best" families in "best" housing
    - "Problem" households in dump estates
        - Pay more for poorer quality housing
        - Aggregate & localize problems

## Spatial and Social Discrimination
- People:
    - Lenders act as social "gatekeepers"
    - Evaluate buyers' ability to repay loans
    - Operational stereotypes of risk
    - Bias towards white-collar. corporate families
- Property:
    - Repossessional potential
    - Investments with liquidity (market demand)
    - Based on housing type, age, location, price
    - Potential locational devaluation deters investment

- **Red-lining**
    - Racialized lending bias is spatialized and accelerates...
        - Disinvestment of inner-city areas
        - Racialized inequalities
    - Redlining in USA:
        - National Housing Act 1934
            - Lenders could withhold mortgages from certain areas
        - 1938: HOLC Security Map Series
        - 1968: Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.; bar all racial discrimination
        - 1977: Community Reinvestment Act
            - All lending discrimination is outlawed

## Rent-Gap Thesis - Neil Smith
- "Return to the city by capital (not people)"
- **Rent-Gap** = "gap" between actual & potential ground rent (land value)
- When the gap gets large enough, investors see potential for profits
- Maps "tax arrears" in the Lower East Side
    - Tax arrears represent disinvestment
    - Maps earliest "turning point" in investment

## 20th Century US Housing Acts
- 1937: Wagner-Steagall Act
    - Created United States Housing Authority
    - Provided subsidies to local public housing agencies (LHAs)
- 1949: The American Housing Act
    - Expansion of the federal role in mortgage insurance and construction of public housing
    - Federal financing for slum clearance programs associated with urban renewal
- 1968: Fair Housing Act
    - Prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, or sex
- 1992: Housing and Community Development Act
    - Amended Wagner Steagall Act of 1937 to increase budget for low-income housing
    - Initiates HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere)
    - Reconstruction of obsolete public housing and reduction of tenant preference

## The City Quietly Remade - Heathcott
- 1942: 1200 families were relocated to racially segregated public housing
    - Clinton Peabody: White & South
    - Car Square Village: Black & North
- 1942-1952: Freeze on federal funds
    - Major housing shortage
    - Push for "slum clearance"
    - Plans for clearance, renewal, and housing
    - Development of "master plan"
- 1947: The city develops a **plan for "slum clearance" identifying "blighted" areas**
- 1952: New post-war public housing
    - John J. Cochrane Gardens & Pruitt-Igoe

### Remaking St. Louis: Key Agents
- Para-political
    - League of Women Voter & Trade Unionists
    - Raised awareness of housing conditions
    - Priority: public housing (housing & jobs)
- Managers
    - Harland Bartholomew, Planner, St. Louis
    - Report on housing shortage
    - Master plan (increase the power of planners)
- Business
    - Change of Commerce, Builders
    - Destroy slums, redevelop downtown, "public housing is a communist plot"
    - Priority: private-sector redevelopment, modernization (private housing)
- State agents
    - Municipal: commitment to public funding
    - Federal: finds for public housing & renewal
    - State: Urban redevelopment corporations

## Case Study of Pruitt-Igoe
- Community designed by Minoru Yamasaki and constructed in 1954
- Racially segregated into:
    - Wendel O. Pruitt homes for African Americans
    - William Igoe apartments for other residents
- Occupancy peaked at 91% in 1957
- By 1971 only 600 peoples inhabited its 17 buildings
- Demolished in 1972

- Failure of design: modernism, high-rise housing, public housing, urban renewal
- Failure of management: did not implement and fund the project adequately

## Defensible Space - Oscar Newman
- Problems of high-rise public housing:
    - Stigmatization
    - Size & density
    - Lack of surveillance
    - No transition between private & public
    - Lack of semi-private, semi-public space
    - Lack of identification
    - Low maintenance & defense
    - Deterioration, crime, community dissolution
- Can design solve social problems?

- Defensible space:
    - Territoriality
        - Sense of home, responsibility in space
        - Entryways define who has access
    - Casual surveillance
        - High visibility of semi-public areas
        - Symbolic barriers mark change function
    - Image
        - Materials and design compatible with surroundings
    - Public social space
        - Areas for defined social interaction
        - Promote sense of community

        - Renovate Cabrini "row" housing (another type of housing)

# Reading Notes: Structures of building provision and the social production of the urban environment- Knox & Pinch (Chapter 6)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What are the key processes that affect the allocation of housing in cities
    - In what ways does the operation of housing markets affect the residential structure of cities

## 6.1: Housing Submarkets

## 6.2: Key Actors in the Social Production of the Built Environment

## Chapter Summary
- 6.1: There are many distinctive housing submarkets in cities that are manifested in the residential structure. While owner-occupation is a form of housing tenure that has been increasing in most Western societies in recent years, private renting has been in decline. The fortunes of both of these sectors has been affected by government policies. Social housing exists in many different forms but has had a profound effect upon the structures of many cities, especially those in Europe
- 6.2: The built environment is not just a reflection of the economics of supply and demand but is affected by institutional factors and the interactions of numerous actors: governments (both local and national), landowners, investors, developers, builders, planners, architects, community activists, and consumers. Social relations of class, gender, and ethnicity affect the ways in which these agencies "sort" different types of people into different residential areas

# Reading Notes: A Regional Growth Ecology, a Great Wall of Capital and a Metropolitan Housing Market - Ley
- Abstract:
    - This article examines the globalization of property in gateway cities, and its contribution to house price inflation in Vancouver (least affordable market in North America)
    - In response to a floundering British Columbia (BC) economy, a favorable investment and immigration climate welcomed capital and invited capitalists to relocate their economic skills into the city
        - Substantial funds flowed to Vancouver from the buoyant Asia Pacific, from distant investors and wealthy immigrants. Capital flows were facilitated by a powerful growth coalition, as the provincial government benefited significantly from these funds, and held a common interest with a vigorous trans-Pacific property industry
    - In conclusion this growth ecology (encouragement of foreign investments into private property and immigration of wealthy immigrants) exacerbated severe unaffordability within the city
        - This pattern can be seen in other cities (Ex: Toronto) however it is especially apparent within Vancouver

- "For private equity firms, insurance companies, sovereign wealth entities, pension funds and wealthy private families, global investment in property as asset has become popular and usually profitable"

- "Global portfolio investment, variably supplemented by wealth migration, have together brought a ‘wall of capital’ to bear upon selected gateway cities like London, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Sydney"
    - "These portals to global flows of capital and labour have become honey-pots for national and global property investors"

- "The result of extensive investment capital chasing finite housing stock has been a dramatic rise in residential unaffordability in gateway cities, with housing costs running far ahead of local wage increases"

- "Of course, such global impacts are not the only ones re-shaping these unaffordable residential markets. A fuller interpretation would include the withdrawal of senior governments from affordable housing production, and the policies of local government, such as rent control in New York and San Francisco, and sustainable growth models, like transit-oriented development or Vancouver’s ‘ecodensity’"

- **Harvey Molotch's urban growth machine** = a coalition of decision-makers from the property sector and government who define the task of urban politics as the promotion and achievement of growth and development

- "Our interpretation of the making of Vancouver’s unaffordable housing market will work with Molotch’s thesis of a growth machine with its focus on urban  property relations"
    - We will identify the chief partners in a growth coalition, an energetic trans-Pacific real estate industry and a free-market provincial government that consistently invited **unrestrained capital flows, permitting speculative investment in the Vancouver property market**
