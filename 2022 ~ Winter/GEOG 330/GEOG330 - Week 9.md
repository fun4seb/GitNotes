# GEOG330 - Week 9: Urbanism

# Lecture Notes: Urbanism

## Wirth's Urbanism as a Way of Life (1938)
- **Large size of cities**; too big to know all others
    - Leads to specialization, impersonal relations, deviance and anomie
- **Density**; too close to engage with all others
    - Physical contacts are close but social contacts are distant
    - Leads to competition for space, specialization of land use, and segregation
- **Heterogeneity**; too diverse to have norms
    - Diversity of the city attracts and creates acceptance of differences, cosmopolitanism, and sophistication

- Wirth: "Urbanism as social organization"
    - **Individual variation:** personal traits occupation, cultural life range
    - **Segmentation:** depend on large and varied groups
    - **Secondary contacts:** replace bonds of kinship and social importance of family
    - **Specialized institutions:** replace family for recreational, industrial, educational activities
    - **Compulsory employment:** no self-employment or means of support outside paid labor
    - **Voluntary groups:** organize into groups to express views and gain status 

## Ambivalent Urbanism
- **Modernity:** All that is solid melts into air
- **Technology:** Speed and mechanization of everyday
- **Capitalism:** Life governed by rigors of industrial capitalism
- **Individualism:** Increased freedom of action
- **"Otherness":** Co-presence of ‘strangers’ = openness

## Claude Fisher’s Idea of Ambivalent Images; Urban-Rural Polarities
- **Rural:**
    - Nature
    - Familiarity
    - Community
    - Tradition
- **Urban:**
    - Art
    - Strangeness
    - Individualism
    - Change

- Constant tension:
    - Thrill of sophistication versus longing for rural
    - Neither attribute is better or worse than other
    - Requires personal choice = **ambivalence**

## Urbanism & Social Theory
- **Durkheim:**
    - Mechanical Solidarity the bonds of likeness)
    - Organic Solidarity (the dependency of difference)
- **Ferdinand Tönnies:**
    - Gemeinschaft (community, village, kinship)
    - Gesellschaft (society, city, social alienation)
- **Georg Simmel:**
    - Intensification of nervous stimuli
    - Rational, calculating, blasé attitude, social reserve, detachment
- **The Chicago School:**
    - Urbanism creates alienation and anomie
    - Social alienation leads to social pathology
- **Defenders of Urbanism:**
    - Urban life as alterity
    - City as melting pot
- **Post-Structural Celebrations of ‘Difference’:**
    - Benjamin, the Flâneur & the Impossible Flâneuse
    - Jacobs, Young & the Ideal of ‘Difference’

## Four Individual Characteristics of Urbanism
1. **Transiency:**
    - Multiple and changing relationships mean low attachment levels
2. **Superficiality:**
    - Highly segmented roles and impersonal and formal relationships
3. **Anonymity:**
    - Lack intimate knowledge of others and few mutual acquaintances
4. **Individualism:**
    - Act in personal rather than collective interest

## Walter Benjamin and the Flâneur
- Celebrated streets & arcades (glass-roofed corridors extending through blocks of buildings) of Paris as sites of modernity

- The "Flâneur" is the "casual stroller" on boulevards
    - Excited by the diversity of crowds
    - Individual liberated through disengagement (voyeur)
    - Sees all but is not ‘seen’ by others
    - Solitude in the multitudes

## The Impossible Flâneuse?
- Janet Wolff critiqued these ideas about modernity and urbanism pointing out the impossibility of the flâneuse
- Gender and ‘race’ are fundamentally inscribed in our social interactions in public; they determine whether or not we can ‘hide’ in the crowd
- Also based in construction of the public and private spheres

## The World of the Stranger
- The city as the world of the stranger:
    - A city is a place where people learn to live with strangers (Sennett)
    - A city is a place where strangers become neighbors (Sandercock)

- The city as a site of alterity:
    - The stranger in the city is the bearer of a new freedom (Simmel)
    - The city and its streets belong to everyone and no one (Lofland)

## Jane Jacobs's "Eyes on the Street"
- Writing against large scale urban renewal and privatization
- Requirements for "safe streets"
    - Kept by residents not police
    - Require density
    - Need ‘eyes’
    - Need clear separation of public & private
    - Require frequent & diverse uses
    - Need diverse commerce
    - Require disorder not order
    - Facilitate secondary contact

## Social Network Theory
- Society is composed of networks of social relationships
- Operates at many scales
    - Micro: Individual (dyads and triads)
    - Meso: Social groups & organizations
        - Random
        - Scale-Free
    - Macro: Large scale (regions)
- Key meso scale networks create greater social capital

- Random (strong) and "scale-free" (weak) networks at the meso-scale:
    - Weak or Scale-Free Networks are full of holes but create access to social capital; ability to "branch out" for social gain
    - Strong or Random Networks bring cohesion but don’t provide outside connections; cannot gain social capital but act as support system

- Granovetter's “The Strength of Weak Ties” (1973)
    - A to B is a bridge tie
    - Bridges are weak
    - Interests of closest ties are advanced to A and B’s connection
    - Weak ties bring new information
    - Thus, weak ties are strong, increasing social capital
    - Strong ties don’t bring new information

- Social networks in space:
    - Social networks are embedded in space: the scale of these ties determines the social order of the neighborhood
    - Cohesive neighborhoods are linked to low social capital and the ‘spatial entrapment’ of a population, who will have strong random meso-scale ties in local space

## Social Distance Theory
- Degree of interaction determined by ‘social distance’
- Social distance: perceptions of individuals towards other groups & identities
    - Short: potential marriage partners
    - Medium: potential friends, colleagues, neighbors
    - Distant: unable to assimilate into social world

- Social distance in space:
    - Segmentation: The greater the social distance, the less likely is social interaction
    - Propinquity: The shorter the social distance the more likely is social interaction
    - Aspatial networks: The more mobile the population the less the propinquity
    - Segregation: The less mobile the population, the more networks are highly localized

# Reading Notes: The Social Dimensions of Modern Urbanism - Knox & Pinch (Chapter 7)
- Questions addressed in this chapter:
    - What are the principle attitudes towards cities in Western societies?
    - How does urban living affect peoples sense of identity?
    - How are social networks structured?
    - What are the main tenets of the Chicago School of human ecology
    - Why has the work of the Chicago School been so influential despite much criticism?
    - How have the ideas of Georg Simmel influenced the study of social relationships in cities?

- "The influence of space and distance on individual behavior and social organization will be a recurring theme in this chapter as we explore the sociospatial dialectic in close-up"

## 7.1: Urban Life in Western Culture
- "People’s satisfaction with their overall ‘quality of life’ and with several major components of well-being tends to decline steadily from rural to metropolitan environments"
    - Despite this dissatisfaction many people who say they prefer rural environments still come to the city in pursuit of a higher material level of living; the city is a "necessary evil"

- Writings of Charles Baudelaire who saw that the city can turn people outward, providing them with **experiences of otherness**; the power of the city to reorient people due to the diversity of peoples within it

- Our cultures (systems of shared meanings) take on a fluidity and a dynamism that is central to the sociospatial dialectic

## 7.2: Urbanism and Social Theory
- Social philosophers such as Durkheim, Weber, Simmel and Tönnies, who were seeking to understand the **social and psychological implications of the urbanism/urbanization** associated with the Industrial Revolution
    - Pre-industrial societies: small and fairly homogeneous populations contain people who know each other, perform the **same kind of work and have the same kind of interests**, they thus tend to look, think and behave alike, reflecting a consensus of values and norms of behavior
    - Industrial urban societies: the inhabitants of large cities constitute part of what Durkheim called a **‘dynamic density’ of population**, subject to new forms of economic and social organization as a result of economic specialization and innovations in transport and communications technology

- In an urbanized, industrial society there is contact with more people but **"primary relationships"** (family and close friends) are less easily sustained
    - social differentiation brings about a divergence of lifestyles, values and aspirations, thus weakening social consensus and cohesion and threatening to disrupt social order; this leads to attempts to adopt "rational" approaches to social organization **(social institutions)**, and where these are unsuccessful, lead to an increase in social disorganization and deviance

### The Chicago School
- Robert Park and the Chicago School believed that urbanization produced new environments, new types of people and new ways of life. The net result, he suggested, was a **"mosaic of little (social) worlds which touch but to not interpenetrate"**
    - They encouraged the exploration and documentation of these social worlds and developed a series of "natural histories" of the distinct social groups within 1920's Chicago (Ex: juvenile gangs, hobos, rooming-houses, prostitutes, taxi-dancers, Jewish ghetto, etc.)

- **Wirthian Theory** = understanding urbanism as a **way of life**; Wirth attributed the social and psychological consequences of city life (i.e. ‘urbanism’) to the combined effects of three factors that he saw as the products of increasing urbanization:
    1. The increased size of populations
    2. The increased density of populations
    3. The increased heterogeneity (differentiation) of populations

- **Psychic overload** = overwhelming stimulus of the urban environment that forces inhabitants to adapt their "normal" behavior in order to cope, becoming aloof and impersonal in their dealings with others
    - The loosening of personal bonds through this adaptive behavior tends to leave people both **unsupported** in times of crisis and **unrestrained** in pursuing ego-centered behavior; The net result is an increase in the incidence of social incompetence, loneliness and mental illness, and deviant behavior of all kinds

- The overall societal response is to replace the support and controls formerly provided by primary social groups with **‘rational’ and impersonal procedures and institutions** (welfare agencies, criminal codes supported by police forces, etc.)
    - According to Wirth, however, such an order can never replace a communal order based on consensus and the moral strength of small primary relationships; as a social norms are so muddled and weak that a **social condition known as "anomie" develops**, in which individuals that are unclear or unhappy about norms challenge or ignore them, thus generating a further source of deviant behavior

- One of the problems with Wirthian theory has been that research studying the helpfulness, conflict, social ties, and psychological stress of urban environments both supports and undermines it
    - Helpfulness of individuals to strangers is indeed weaker within cities
    - Group conflict between racial, social, and economic classes is more common within cities and large communities
    - However the number and quality of social ties is either the same compared to rural communities, or stronger in urban settings
    - Levels of psychological stress are the same, if not greater, in rural communities

### The Public and Private Worlds of City Life
- Keeping in mind the problems with Wirthian theory, it is important to re-conceptualize the urban settings and recognize the differences between the **public and private spheres of urban life**
    - In the public sphere people are strangers and requires a special etiquette: reserved, careful, non-intrusive, and in general appear to be indifferent to other people in order to avoid **"exposure"** to pain
    - Despite this attitude in the public, city dwellers do not lose the capacity for the deep and long-lasting relationships, they just gain the capacity for the surface, fleeting, restricted relationships that keep one from harm in such dense communities of strangers

- In other words, **"urbanism produces fear and distrust of “foreign” groups in the public sphere, but does not affect private social worlds"**; this means that urbanism accommodates both "moral order" and "social disorganization"

- The construction of "self" in public and private spheres:
    - our ‘selves’ are, to a certain extent, constructed by others in close geographic proximity; We have to accommodate the meanings, roles and identities imposed on ourselves through the expectations of others
    - people repress and restructure their feelings in order to cope with the demands and expectations of others; the construction of the **"false self"**

## 7.3: Social Interaction and Social Networks in Urban Settings
- Most people are involved in several different social relationships, some of which are **interconnected** to some extent
    - The way in which these social linkages are structured is often very complex and represent the foundations of social organization; the analysis of these linkages is called **social network analysis**

### Social Network Analysis
- Social network analysis attempts to illustrate the structure of social interaction by treating persons as points and relationships as connecting lines, allowing researchers to map out the complex nature of an individuals' social world

- Despite the helpfulness of this form of analysis, the study of social networks does not provide the urban social geographer with a sufficiently holistic approach; there remain the fundamental questions regarding the extent to which social networks of various kinds are spatially defined, and at what scales

### Urban Social Ecology as a "Shaper" and Outcome of Social Interaction
- The most distinctive feature of the approach adopted by the human ecologists of the Chicago School is the conception of the city as a kind of social organism, with an individual behavior and social organization governed by a "struggle for existence"

- Park concluded that order in human communities must emerge through the operation of "natural" processes such as dominance, segregation, impersonal competition and succession; **a naive view that emerged when the appeal of "social Darwinism" was strong**

- One of the central concepts was that of **impersonal competition** (struggle) between individuals for favorable locations within the city
    - This struggle was acted out primarily through **market mechanisms**, resulting in a characteristic pattern of **land rents and the consequent segregation of different types of people** according to their ability to meet the rents associated with different sites and situations
    - As the competitive power of different groups altered, and the relative attractiveness of different locations changed in the course of time, these territories were seen to shift (Ex: Burgess model's "zone in transition")

- **Burgess model of concentric zones**; the spatial model of the Chicago School
    - Observations on the location and extent of specific communities formed the basis for the identification of an urban spatial structure consisting of a series of **concentric zones**

- Within this broad framework three types of study were produced by the school of human ecologists:
    1. Studies focusing on the process of competition, dominance and succession and their consequences for the spatial distribution of populations and land use
    2. Detailed descriptions of the physical features of ‘natural’ areas along with the social, economic and demographic characteristics of their inhabitants
    3. Studies of the ecological context of specific social phenomena such as delinquency, prostitution and mental disorders. A central concern was the investigation of ecologies that seemed to generate high levels of deviant behavior

- **Criticisms of the ecological approach of the Chicago School:**
    - The most general criticisms were directed towards the biological analogies which had become increasingly criticized due to the parallel concepts used to justify the territorial claims of Hitler's Third Reich
    - Other criticisms were directed towards the over-reliance on competition as a basis of understanding social organization that didn't hold up to comparative examination, and its almost complete exclusion of cultural and motivational factors explaining residential behavior
    - The last and most damaging criticism was based around how the Chicago School overlooked the role of "sentiment" and "symbolism" in influencing peoples behavior in residential organization

### Social Interaction in Urban Environments
## Chapter Summary
- 7.1: Western attitudes towards urban living are characterized by hostility, yet cities are also seen as centers of diversity and opportunity
- 7.2: The Chicago School of urban sociology interpreted cities through analogy with ideas from plant and animal ecology. Wirthian ideas stressed the destabilizing effect of increasing size, density and heterogeneity of population on existing social norms. Subsequent research has stressed that personal identities are critically influenced by factors such as class, community, work and family
- 7.3: People belong to different, non-overlapping social networks that vary in structure and intensity. Although highly influential, the ideas of the Chicago School failed to adequately reconcile the relationships between ‘economic’ and ‘cultural’ factors in cities. Physical and social distance are intimately connected in urban areas
