# Lecture Notes: Introduction to Resource Analysis and Management
- Idea of viewing the globe at night (black marble) to see how human cities/energy consumption (designated by light production seen at night from space) are distributed across the world
    - Points of light (major settlements) as **attractors for resources** and **centers for energy consumption**
    - The location of settlements is often determined by geological features
        - River valleys such as the Nile and Indus river valley, due to their natural resources and location, facilitate the development of civilization and this intensification of civilization around these sites can be seen from space by following the lights
        - Mountain ranges like the Himalayas can define the extent of a civilization as well (Ex: India)

- Statements about **if people dominate, or are dominated by the environment**; which is right?
    1. People adjust to their environment
    2. People adjust their environment
    3. People should adjust to their environment
    4. People should adjust their environment

## Sharing the Earth's Natural Resources
- The interface between Earth and people is the **utilization of natural resources**
    - The Earth is dynamic
    - People are dynamic
    - **Who gets to use what?**
        - Relevant texts: Who Gets What, When, How - Harold D. Lasswell (1936) & United Nations Resource Management System - UNECE Energy Series

### The Earth
- All the resources we have access to as humans come from this one planet
- In addition to this all the resources we have access to as humans is dynamic and changing due to the fact that the **Earth is dynamic and changing**
    - The resources we have do not stay fixed in time or space
    - This means humans need to **cooperate** for the dynamic and changing share of resources available to us on Earth

- How **green** is the Earth from space (green marble visualization)

- The Earth as a **Biosphere**; made up of smaller "spheres" encompassing different domains within the Earth's systems
    - **Lithosphere (land)**
        - The underlying rock of the Earth, present before the Earth had any water; where all our mineral resources are located, includes the tectonic plates
    - **Biosphere (biological life)**
        - All of the living things on the Earth and how they are interacting with the other spheres
    - **Cryosphere (ice)**
        - Contains all the frozen water locked up in ice throughout the globe
    - **Atmosphere (air)**
        - Gas layer surrounding the Earth 
    - **Hydrosphere (water)**
        - The water of the Earths that carves and shapes the Lithosphere

### Three Fundamental Ways to Get People to Cooperate
- Back in the 1980's, a Berkley Political Science Professor William K. "Sandy" Muir taught that there are **three kinds of power:**
    - Coercion/brute force/hostage taking; **Power of the Sword** (strongest, most aggressive gets own way via intimidation)
    - Reciprocity/economic/money; **Power of the Purse** (richest, most resource-laden gets own way via money/trading)
    - Persuasion/leadership/moral power' **Power of the Pen** (most charismatic, most convincing gets own way via words)

- Most interactions that involve transfers of resources involve a synthesis of these three power spheres: **reciprocity, persuasion, and coercion**

### Questions about Use: Who gets to use what?
- Are there different kinds of use that need different classification?
    - If yes, should some uses have priority? Why? **(Moral power)**
    - If no, then what is there to prevent the strongest/fastest from taking everything **(Coercion)**
    - Limits on economic benefit of one group? **(Reciprocity)**

- Is there a clear different between a legitimate use (making a medication, or saving space for diverse animals) and exploitation (making an absurd profit, or forcing people away from their ancestral place), or is it always/usually somewhat fuzzy and open to interpretation depending on the argument (R&D costs, banking resources for future generation that otherwise are gone before possibly knowing their value)

- Can you have **Liberty (freedom to do whatever you want)** and **Equality (equal access to resources for all)** at the same time in the content of Natural Resource use?
