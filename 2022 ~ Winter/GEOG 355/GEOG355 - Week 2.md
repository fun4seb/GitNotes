# GEOG355 - Week 2: Hydrosphere (Oceans and Fisheries)
- Learning to be observationalists; observing the patterns governing the world's processes

# Lecture Notes: Oceanography
- Importance of **phytoplankton** (and zooplankton) in regulating the carbon in the atmosphere
    - Worlds largest migration occurs everyday as zooplankton move from the surface waters deeper and back again, allowing for **carbon flux**

- Importance of the 1000 year global current in regulating global temperatures and allowing oxygenated water to reach the ocean floor

- Ways of observing the patterns in the ocean:
    - Using sonar imagining (like a fish finder) to map concentrations of plankton (or other things) at various depths within a column of water
