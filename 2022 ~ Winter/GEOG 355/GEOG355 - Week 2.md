# GEOG355 - Week 2: Hydrosphere (Oceans and Fisheries)
- Learning to be **observationalists**; observing the patterns governing the world's processes

- **Topics of this week:**
    - Oceanography:
        - How to become an "observationalist"; observation technology (sonar, etc.)
        - Importance of phytoplankton and global currents in regulating atmospheric carbon and heat distribution
    - Fisheries:
        - Collapse of Cod industry in Canada

# Lecture Notes: Hydrosphere
- Surface density of the ocean:
    - Densest regions of surface water are in the **North Atlantic** and South Pole he entire world, surface water is **least dense at the equator**
    - Surface density is driving the way heat is transported from the Equator to the poles

- Importance of **phytoplankton** (and zooplankton) in regulating the carbon in the atmosphere
    - Worlds largest migration occurs everyday as zooplankton move from the surface waters deeper and back again, allowing for **carbon flux**

- Importance of the 1000 year global current in regulating global temperatures and allowing oxygenated water to reach the ocean floor

- Ways of observing the patterns in the ocean:
    - Using sonar imagining (like a fish finder) to map concentrations of plankton (or other things) at various depths within a column of water

## Fisheries
- Economics of fishery significant for Canada: https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/sustainable-durable/fisheries-peches/index-eng.html
- Institutional factors include deep divides between different players in the fishing industry often lead to conflict: https://thewalrus.ca/the-new-lobster-wars/
- Resolving the “You cant manage what you cant count” issue requires our best science: https://dosits.org/people-and-sound/fishing/how-is-sound-used-to-locate-fish/

- Ecological factors governing larval fish survival change dramatically on annual time scales, “within the range of natural variability”, and longer time scales, where human impacts can start to take a greater toll on survival

### The Decline of Atlantic Cod - A Case Study
- While Canada exports lots of fish, it is hard to find Canadian (sustainably farmed) fish in super markets in Canada; scarcity of Cod in Canada due to history of over-fishing while in Norway Cod populations are strong and healthy

- Context of fishery industry collapse in 1992
    - Over-fishing, enabled by the development and widespread use of **fish-finders**, that exceeded the **maximum sustainable yield** (max amount you can fish while still being able to grow back)

## Soundscapes
- Way of using the spectrum of sound frequencies to model the presence of organisms in an (ideally undisturbed) area
    - Gives 3D feedback to everything sensing vibrations; huge variety of organisms

- Anyone can “pollute” it:
    - **Sound Signals**
        - Sounds directly communicating something (Ex: "look", "listen", "stop")
    - **Sound Markers**
        - Sounds that tell you where you are; sounds unique to a certain setting (Ex: sounds of a classroom soundscape vs. playground soundscape)
    - **Sound Disrupters**
        - Sounds that make noise but don't convey information; pollute the sound spectrum and "block out" sound markers (Ex: jackhammer sounds)

- **Is Sound a Manageable Resource?**
    - Soundscape changes over time; recording provides a snapshot in time informing on the state of the ecosystem that can be compared to past/future
    - Needed for communication
    - Income disparities affect the soundscape that people live and learn in
    - How do you go about protecting it?

## What is a Natural Resource?
- Maybe define it as what it is not?
    - Are there "un-natural" resources?
    - Is it only a natural Resource if humans use it?
    - Is air a natural resource? Water? Space (either kind)? Time?

- Is it just anything found on the Earth? > “Everything on Earth is a Natural Resource)
- Is it only a resource if it is useful now? > How do you measure and value potential over TIME?)
- Can/Should anyone that can think of a use for something they find get a chance to try it? > “Use it or lose it” mentality to allow faster development of technologies to make life “better” for everyone?

- Since since we have only one Earth, and planetary supplies is limited, who gets what and how much?
    - Links in to the Tragedy of the Commons
    - This is where the Management side comes in...
        - People interacting with resources can lead to sub-optimal results
        - Management => Finding Strategies to help Interacting People move in Positive Directions

- Critical to make sure that everyone's position is not just heard but listened to

### Management Strategies of Natural Resources
- **Fundamental principles of resource management introduced in the UN Resource Management System:**
    1. State rights and responsibilities in the management of resources
    2. Responsibility to the planet
    3. Integrated and indivisible management of resources
    4. Social contract on natural resources
    5. Service orientation
    6. Comprehensive resource recovery
    7. Circularity
    8. Health and safety
    9. Innovation
    10. Transparency
    11. Continuous strengthening of core competencies and capabilities

- Resource management decisions have historically been made on a project-by-project or sector-by-sector basis, and usually by a single government entity or individual companies
    - This fragmented approach has many problems such as lacking a broad, birds eye view perspective, results in limited diversity of knowledge and viewpoints used to support decision-making
    - The concepts presented in this UN report emphasize the need for a **globally unified, holistic system**

- The process of sustainable resource management starts from an understanding of the world's natural capital and natural resources; **we must first know how much of a resource there is before we can begin to manage it**
    - **Natural capital** = worlds stock of natural assets (resources)
