# GEOG355 - Week 3: Atmosphere (Energy and Carbon)
- **Topics of this week:**
    - Atmospheric carbon
        - History of global CO2 patterns
        - Carbon cycle
    - Atmosphere modelling

# Lecture Notes: Atmosphere
- History of CO2 production:
    - For 400,000 years atmospheric CO2 stayed relatively stable, fluctuating annually withe the seasons
    - Atmospheric carbon levels have grown exponentially ever since the **industrial revolution**

- The Northern hemisphere emits more CO2 than the Southern hemisphere
    - This is due to the abundance of people and developed countries living in the Northern hemisphere vs the Southern, and the distribution of plants being more concentrated in the Northern hemisphere

- The balance between incoming sunlight and outgoing heat determines the climate
    - Greenhouse gasses (like CO2) create a blanket around the atmosphere that traps heat from escaping, upsetting the balance and leading to climate change

## The Carbon Cycle
- **Carbon sinks**
    - On land, plants remove carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis
    - In the ocean, carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere and stored near the surface where it is photosynthesized by phytoplankton to produce new plant matter and oxygen
        - As plankton die they sink to the ocean floor along with the CO2; the ocean floor is a huge carbon reservoir
        - The ocean holds around 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere
        - As the ocean absorbs CO2 it becomes more acidic over time, threatening biodiversity
- **Carbon producers**
    - Land animals eat plants and breath out CO2
    - When plants and animals die/decay, they transfer carbon back into the soil
    - Burning trees or fossil fuels (human activity)

## Atmosphere Modelling
- **Global public goods** = publicly available resources that we all share and benefit from (Ex: atmosphere, oceans, etc.)
    - There are also global public "bads" such as pollution, carbon, waste, etc.

- In order to accurately model the circulation of carbon in the atmosphere we must not only show what is absorbing/emitting carbon, but **how much** this is being done (measured in Gigatons of Carbon)
    - Human practices such as driving cars and running industries **vastly outweigh** the emissions of things such as volcanoes, animal respiration, etc.; humans are the problem driving exponential growth of atmospheric carbon levels

- "Bathtub"/reservoir model of the input and output of atmospheric CO2
    - **CO2 inflow** = The tap filling the tub represents CO2 emissions into the atmosphere
    - **CO2 stock** = The volume of water in the tub represents the total CO2 in the atmosphere
    - **CO2 outflow** = The drain emptying water represents the net removal of CO2 in the atmosphere
    - The problem is that the inputs of CO2 flowing into the tub are greater than the net removals moving out of the tub, meaning eventually the tub will overflow (climate change) as the balance is not in equilibrium
