# GEOG355 - Week 4: Biosphere Diversity (Forests and the Carbon Cycle)

# Lecture Notes: Biosphere
- **Biosphere topics:**
    - Biosphere valuation; how is value put on nature
    - Forests

## How to Evaluate Value
- **Natural capital accounting** = deciding how to value land, water, and forest; value of ecosystem services
    - We must analyze the value of what comes to humans from nature (this doesn't get priced by markets)

- **Cost-benefit analysis** = evaluating the costs and benefits of a specific opportunity and deciding the most beneficial course of action to make the most profit
    - Financial cost benefit vs. economic cost benefit analysis
        - Financial analysis compares benefits and costs to the enterprise (local), while the economic analysis compares the benefits and costs to the whole economy

- How many resources people have in an area determines how much they are willing to pay for it (scarcity/supply)
