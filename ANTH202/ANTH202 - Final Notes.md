# ANTH202 - Final Notes

# Illness, Health & Disease

## Illness vs. disease

* Disease refers to a biological health problem that is objective and universal, such as a bacterial or viral infection or a broken arm
* Illness refers to culturally specific perceptions and experiences of a health problem

## Cultural Conditions

> Culture-Specific Syndrome ~ A health problem and set of symptoms associated with a particular culture

* Social factors are often an underlying cause
* Biophysical symptoms may occur through somatization

### Awas

> Awas ~ common childhood illness among newborn Mayans within Guatamala, Children born with awas have lumps under the skin, marks on the skin, or albinism. People say that events that happen to the mother during her pregnancy cause awas: She may have been denied food she desired or have been pressured to eat food she did not want, or she may have encountered a rude, drunk, or angry person (usually a man). Therefore, to prevent awas in babies, the Maya are extremely considerate of pregnant women. A pregnant woman, like land before planting, is sacred.

### Susto

> Susto ~ fright/shock disease, a culture specific illness found in spain and portugal and among latino people wherever they live; symptoms include back pain, fatigue, weakness, and lack of appetite.

### Gotai

> Gotai ~ In Japan, the concept of gotai refers to the ideal of maintaining bodily intactness in life and death, to the extent of not piercing one’s ears. Underlying the value of an intact body is the belief that an intact body ensures rebirth. Historically in Japan, a warrior’s practice of beheading a victim was the ultimate form of killing because it violated the integrity of the body and prevented the enemy’s rebirth. Gotai is an important reason for the low rates of surgery in Japan, compared to the United States, and the widespread popular resistance to organ transplantation.

### The Widow Ghost

>  In rural northern Tailand 1990, fear of an attack by ghosts spread throughout the area. It was based on several radio reports of unexplained deaths of Thai migrant men working in Singapore. People interpreted the sudden deaths of men as caused by “widow ghosts.” Widow ghosts roam about, searching for men with whom they want to have sexual intercourse.

* Mary Beth Mills was conducting research in that village region at the time of the fear. After being away for a few days, she returned to find the 200 households decorated with wooden phalluses
* People would put wooden dicks on their doors in the hopes that widow ghosts would have sex with the wooden dicks instead of killing men through intercourse

## Medical Anthropology (3 Different Approaches)

### Ecological/Epidemiological Approach

> Studies the interaction of the environment and culture to explain the cause and spread of health problems

* Tends to rely on quantitative data
* Applied emphasis: to provide findings for public health programs
* Considers issues such as infectious disease, ubanization, other "stressors"

### Symbolic/Interpretivist Approach

> Focus on understanding illness and healing as symbolic and enacted as meaningful performance

* Healing as providing symbolic meaning through the placebo effect, or meaning effect
* Example: shamanic song among the Guna Indians to help in difficult births

### Critical Medical Anthropology

> Focus on how economic, political power structures, and inequality (structural suffering, structural violence) affect health and access to healing

#### Issues

* Affliction is more a product of someones social status
* Economic and political systems create health inequalities
* Poverty is a major cause of suffering, death
* Western doctor-patient relationships as a form of social control
* Western medicine emphasizes technology and is dehamanizing

## Ethnomedicine

> Ethnomedicine ~ Study of cross-cultural medical systems

* A health system ecompasses many areas:
  - Perceptions and classifications of health problems
  - Preventative measures
  - Diagnosis
  - Healing (magical, religious, scientific, healing substances)
  - Healers
* Cultures differ in how they define peoples bodies:
  - Perception of what a "body" is
  - Perception of interal and external parts
  - Seperation of mind and body
  - Attitudes towards death
  - Attitudes towards surgery

### Western Biomedicine (WBM)

> WBM ~ A healing approach based on modern Western science that emphasizes technology in diagnosing and treating health problems related to the human body

* Is an ethnomedical system

## Healing Systems

### Healing Ways

* Community Healing
  - Example: Ju/Wasi
  - Mobilization of community "energy" as a cure
  - All-night healing dances
  - Open access to everyone

* Humoral Healing
  - Example: Malaysia
  - Based on balance among elements in the body
  - Different foods/drugs have different "heating" or "cooling" effects
    - Difference between heating and cooling varies between cultures as in some heating is associated with death or visa versa

# Kinship

## Kinship Diagram vs Geneology

> Kinship Diagram ~ Schematic way of presenting the kinship relationships of an individual, called ego, using a set of symbols to depict all the kin relations of ego

> Geneology ~ Schematic way of presenting a family tree, constructed by beginning with the earliest ancestors that can be traced, then working down to the present. **Geneology DOES NOT begin with ego (main difference)**

## Forms of descent

> Unilineal Decent ~ Tracing of ones decent through only one parent

> Bilineal Decent ~ Tracing of ones decent rhough both parents

### Unilineal Decent

* Basis of kinship in 60% of the worlds cultures; most common form of decent
* Found in societies with a fixed resource base, such as:
  - Pastoralists
  - Horticulturists
  - Farmers

### Patrilineal Decent

* Traced through the male line
* Only male members are considered part of the kinship lineage
* Found in 45% of all cultures such as South & East Asia, Middle East, New Guinea, Northern Africa

### Matrilineal Decent

* Traces through the female line
* Only female members are considered part of the kinship lineage
* Found in 15% of all cultures such as Native American groups

### Bilineal Decent

* Traces kinship through both parents equally
* Found in one third of the world's cultures and most common on both ends of the modes-of-livelihood
  - Example: Ju/Wasi foragers and most uban professionals
* Bilineal decent makes sense for both foraging and industrial/digital groups because it promotes small kinship units and allows for spatial mobility of the small units.

## Marriages

> Marriage ~ more or less stable union, usually between two people, who may or may not be coresidential, sexually involved with each other, and procreative with each other

* Functions of the relationship includes sex, legitimacy of children, shared property, and coresidence

### Forms of Marriage

> Monogamy ~ Marriage between two people

> Polygamy ~ Marriage between more than two people

### Preference Rules

* Preference includes things like age, height, wealth, education
* Endogamy and exogamy are preference rules

> Endogamy ~ Marriage within a particular region or social category

> Exogamy ~ Marriage outside a particular region or social category

### Status Consideration in Partner Selection

* Hypergyny: bride marries a groom of higher status
* Hypogyny: bride marries a groom of lower status
* Isogamy: bride and groom are status equals

### Costs and Gifts

* Often involves gifts/exchange between bride and groom's family
  - Dowry
  - Groomprice
  - Brideprice
  - Brideservice

* Weddings “crystallize” and highlight cultural meanings of the marital relationship and gender roles leading to very expensive or very simple 

### Cousin Marriage

* Forbidden/prefered in some cultures
* Varying definitions of what is a cousin
  - Prefering cousins on mothers vs fathers side (is either side more taboo/prefered than the other?)

## Households

### Family vs Household

* Family is a group of people who are related by kinship
* Household is a person(s) who live together and may or may not be related by kinship
* Distinction is important

### Types of Households

* Nuclear Household
  - Common worldwide but not always preferred depending on location
  - Found in foragers and industrial/digital groups
  - Most common North American household type however is declining as single households increase

* Extended Household
  - Common among horticulturists, pastoralists, agriculturists
  - Related to fixed economic base/property
  - Extended vertically through parents and sons/daughters or horizontally though siblings
  - Provides safe net for child care and old age support

* Stem Household
  - Common in East Asia
  - Formation includes parents and one offspring (usually son), and his spouse + children
  - In some ways a sub-type of extended household but limited to extension through just one decendant

### Household Headship

* Household head is primarily responsible for supporting the household financially and makes the major decisions
* Model of male head: based on Euro-American, male biased view
* Matrifocality: household in which a woman is the central domestic figure. Common among lower income people in the Caribbean, Central/South America, United States

### Domestic Violence

* Found in most but not all cultures
* Could invlove:
  - Child abuse
  - Honor killings
  - Partner abuse: more common where men control the wealth and women are dependant on them

## Incest taboo

> Incest Taboo ~ Strong prohibition against marrying or having sex within kinship

* Most basic and universal form of incest taboo is against marriage or sexual intercourse between fathers and their children and between mothers and their children
* Most cultures forbid brother–sister marriage but there are exceptions.
  - Brother–sister marriage was an accepted practice in Egypt at the time of the Roman Empire. Norm among royalty, and common among the general population. Between 15 and 20 percent of marriages were between full brothers and sisters.

# Social Groups & Stratification

## Social Groups

> Social Groups ~ Cluster of people beyond the domestic unit who are usually related on grounds other than kinship

* Social groups could include friendships, clubs and fraternities/sororities, cooperatives, self-help groups etc.
* Varries in degrees of formality/informality
* Foragers tend to have fewer forms of social groups than other modes
* Industrial/digital economy societies have a wide variety, maybe due to kinship playing a less important role

### Primary vs Secondary Social Groups

> Primary Social Group ~ People who interact with each other and know each other personally

> Secondary Social Group ~ People who identify with each other on some basis but who may never meet each other or know each other personally

## Clubs & Fraternities

> Clubs & Fraternities ~ Social groups that define membership in terms of a sense of shared identity and objectives

* Mainly people share the same ethnic heritage
* Provide social and psychological support to members but have political and economic functions, too (connections, networking, jobs)
* College fraternities and sororities in North America (the “Greek system”) are highly selective and serve a variety of functions, such as entertainment, matchmaking, and social service

### Peggy Sanday: Study of Gang Rape in U.S. Fraternities

* Study of initiation rituals and male bonding in an Ivy League university of the U.S. northeast
* Not characteristic of all U.S. fraternities
* In some, ritual of the “train” in which a woman is gang-raped by the brothers

### Men's Houses & Gynophobia

* Seperate "men's houses" exist in many cultures
  - Example: Indigenous Amazonian groups
* Women who look into the men's houses are punished by gang rape
* **Interpretation: related to cultures that value male aggression**

## Counterculture Groups

> Counterculture Groups ~ Groups that form outside the "mainstream" that resist conforming to the dominant cultural pattern

* Members desire to be identified with a special group and thus hold a group identity
  - Examples include youth gangs and body modification groups

## Youth Gangs

* Group of young people in mainly urban areas
* Considered to be a social problem by mainstream society
* Usually have recognized leader like clubs & fraternities
* Most/all have rituals of initiation and symbols of membership (clothing, specific colors, tattoos)

### Study of Youth Gangs in the U.S.

* Found that personalities of youth gang members fall under **5 characteristics**:
  1. Intensive competitiveness
  2. Mistrust of others
  3. Self-reliance
  4. Social isolation
  5. Strong survival instinct

### Structuralist View of Youth Gangs

* Personality characteristics are the result of poverty in member's communities
* Members join because they want the same things as mainstream groups (like fraternities) but dont have access to those through legal paths to success

### Masta Liu

* Group located in Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific
* Example of an informal youth gang with no formal leadership hierarchy or initiation rituals
* Unemployment is the primary unifying feature of the male youths who become Masta Liu
* Most have migrated to the city from the countryside to escape what they consider an undesirable lifestyle (working in the fields under control of their elders)
* Some Liu live with extended kin in the city; others organize Liu-only households.
* Lie spend their time wandering around town, referred to locally as going wakabaot, in groups of up to 10
* Essentially a youth gang unified by being impovershed and the fact they all "escaped" the countryside to slum it in the city

## Body Modification Groups

* Countercultural movement in the United States, includes people who have a sense of community strengthened through forms of body alteration.

### James Myers California Study

* Study done in California among people who feel they are a special group because of their interest in permanent body modification, especially **genital piercing, branding, and cutting**
* The study population included males and females, heterosexuals, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and SMers
  - The single largest group was SM homosexuals and bisexuals
  - Demographic was mainly White, and most had either attended or graduated from college.
* Myers witnessed many modification sessions at workshops
  - Those seeking modification go up on a stage and have their chosen procedure done by a well-known expert
  - This public event is a kind of initiation ritual that binds the expert, the volunteer, and the group together
  - Pain is an important part of many rites of passage, the audience witnesses and validates the experience and becomes joined to the initiate through witnessing modifications as a community

## Friendship

* Close social ties between at least two people, usually informal, voluntary, and, traditionally, involving face-to-face interaction
  - New communications technology challenges that characteristic as friends can now be made and maintained through phonecalls and online
* May contribute to economic security
  - Example: research by Carol Stack
* Related to microcultural factors: gender, age, class, ethnicity, and institutions

### Social Characteristics of Friendships

* Criteria for who qualifies as a friend may be culturally structured
  - Gender segregation may prevent cross-gender friendships and promote same-gender friendships, and racial segregation may limit cross-”race” friendships.
* Friends are supportive of each other, psychologically and sometimes materially. Support is mutual, shared back and forth in an expectable way as in balanced exchange
  - Example: swapping stories in Guyana
* Friendship **generally occurs between social equals**, although there are exceptions
  - Examples: friendships between older and younger people, supervisor and a staff worker, teacher and a student.

## Carol Stack’s research

* Research is regarding friendship among uban poor people in the U.S.
* Shows how friendship networks promote economic survival among low-income, urban African Americans
* She conducted fieldwork in “The Flats,” the poorest section of a Black community in a large midwestern city and found extensive networks of friends **“supporting, reinforcing each other—devising schemes for self-help, strategies for survival in a community of severe economic deprivation”**
* People in the Flats, especially women, maintain a set of friends through exchange: “swapping” goods (food, clothing) needed by someone at a particular time, sharing “child keeping,” and giving or lending food stamps and money
* Exchanges are part of a clearly understood pattern
  - Gifts and favors go back and forth over time. Friends thus bound together are obligated to each another and can call on each other in time of need
* In opposition to theories that suggest the breakdown of social relationships among the very poor, this research documents how poor people strategize and cope through social ties. **Poverty PROMOTES social relationships instead of hindering it**

## Castes

> Caste ~ Social stratification system linked with hinduism

* Based on a persons birth into a certain group
* Varnas: four + 1 major social categories:
  1. Brahmans - Priests
  2. Kshatriyas - Warriors
  3. Vaishyas - Merchants
  4. Shudras - Laborers
  5. Dalits - "untouchables" (lowest group and essentially worthless trash compaired to higher level groups)
* Caste system is maintained through:
  - Marriage rules (primarily in-group marriage called **"jati endogamy"**)
  - Spatial segregation
  - Rituals
* Indian consitution of 1949 declared discrimination based on caste illegal
  - Equality is increasing steadily especially since the late 20th century

# Politics & Social Order

## Types of Political Leadership & Organizations

* 3 aspects of political leadership:
  1. Power: the ability to bring about results, often through possession or use of force
  2. Authority: the ability to bring about results based on a person’s status, respect, and reputation in the community
  3. Influence: the ability to achieve a desired end by exerting social or moral preassure on someone or some group

* 4 types of organizations:
  - Bands
  - Tribes
  - Chiefdoms
  - States

### Power vs authority

* Authority differs from power in two ways:
  1. power is backed up by the potential use of force
  2. power can be wielded by an individual who lacks authority
* Having authority means someone is respected and has pull in their environment, you can hold authority over people without force through social preasure
* Example would be that militia or revolutionary forces can have power however they lack political or social authority over their environment

## Bands

* Foraging groups
* Between 20 and a few hundred people; everyone knows one another and are kin
* Membership is flexible
* Leader is “first among equals”
* Leader has influence, perhaps authority, but no power

## Tribes

### Moka

In several tribes in the Mount Hagen area of the Papua New Guinea highlands, an aspiring big-man develops a leadership position through the moka process

> Moka ~ Strategy for developing political leadership in Melanesia that involves exchanging favors and gifts, such as pigs, and sponsoring large feasts where further gift-giving occurs

### Headman

* Solves conflict within tribes
* Headman will be in charge of determining the times for moving herds, planting, and harvesting and for setting the time for seasonal feasts and celebrations. Internal and external conflict resolution is also his responsibility
* Relies mainly on authority and influence and less on power. These strategies are effective because tribal members are all kin and are loyal to each other
* More formal and demanding than a band leader
* Political leader on a part-time basis only

## Chiefdoms

* Permanently allied tribes and villages under one leader
* More centralized and socially complex than bands or tribes
* Heritable systems of social rank and economic stratification
* Chiefship is an "office"/title that must be held by someone at any one time
* Confederacies are formed when chiefdoms are joined

## States

* Centralized political unite comprised of many communities
* Bureaucratic structure
* Leader has coercive power

### State Powers & Roles

* Engages in international relations
* Monopolize use of force through organized police and military force to maintain law and order
* Define citizenships, rites, responsibilities
* Keep track on citizens through census
* Taxation
* Control and manipulate information
* Provide social services

### Symbols of State Power

* May connect leaders to deities
* Leaders may have special dress, housing, food, transportation, etc. that distinguish them from general population

### Gender and Leadership in States

* Most modern states are hierarchical an patriarchal to different degrees
* Highest rates of women in politics is in the **Nordic States**
* Womens political roles often indirect or tied to kinship

## Social Norms & Law

> Social Norm ~ A generally agreed-upon standard for how people behave, **unwritten, learned unconciously**

* All societies have norms
* Norms include, for example, the expectation that children should follow their parents’ advice, that people standing in line should be orderly, and that an individual should accept an offer of a handshake
* Enforcement of norms is informal
  - Violation of norms would be considered rude and may be subject to ridicule
* Recent poli-sci concept of **global norms**, a value held universally and enforced as such.
  - Example of a global norm would be womens equality in the public domain

> Law ~ A binding rule created through enactment or custom that defines right and reasonable behavior and is enforceable under threat of punishment

* Systems of laws are more common and elaborate in state-level societies however many non-state societies have formalized laws
* Religion often provides legitimacy for laws
  - The terms law and religion are synonymous in contemporary Islamic states
  - Secular Western states consider their laws to be religiously neutral, although, in fact, much Western law is based on Judeo-Christian beliefs

## Systems of Social Control

* Vary depending on social scale
* In small-scale societies: face-to-face groups, social control is less formal and more likely to be based only on norms
* In large-scale societies: norms regulate daily life but so do laws; punishment for violation of laws can be serious, including death

### Small-Scale

* Disputes handled at interpersonal level
* Groups may punish an individual with shaming, ridicule, ostracism
* Emphasis on restoring order rather than punishment

### Large-Scale

* Increased specialization of roles involved in social control
  - Police
  - Lawyers
  - Judges
* Formal trials and courts
* **Power** enforced punishment such as prison or death penalty

### Police

* Form of social control that involves surveillance and threat of punishment
* Police discover, report, and investigate crimes defined by the state

### Trials and Courts

* Trial by ordeal: a way of judging guilt or innocence by putting the accused person through a test that is often painful
* Court system used in many contemporary societies
* Goal is to ensure justice and fairness
* Biases (such as racial, ethnic, gender) affect the achievement of the goal

### Prisons and Death Penalty

* The prison, as a place where people are forcibly detained as a form of punishment, has a long history
* The United States imprisons more people than any other country in the world
* Executions communicate a political message to the general populace about the state’s power and strength
