# ANTH202 - Week 4

## Making a living

* Five modes of livelyhood
  - Foraging
  - Horticulture
  - Pastoralism
  - Agriculture
  - Industrial/Digital

### Economic System

What is an Economic System?
* Livelihood (production)
  - Providing for basic needs and other needs by procuring goods or making money
* Consumption
  - Using up goods or money
* Exchange
  - The transfer of goods or money between people or institutions

> Emic = inside pov
> Etic = researchers pov

## Modes of Livelihood and Globalization

* Western capitalism has marked effects on all other livelihood patterns it meets
* Increasing focus of research is how global and local economic systems are linked
* Low-income countries are at a disadvantage to high-income countries

### Pros of Globalization

* 1 billion less people in extreme poverty than 25 years ago
* Consumers can buy more for cheaper

### Cons of Globalization

* Environmental effects
* Job market took a hit
* promotes corporate monopoly

## Foraging

* Based on obtaining foods already available within nature
  - Hunting, fishing, gathering
  - Main economic strategy for most of human history
* Two types of foraging
  1. Temperate Climate Foraging
  2. Circumpolar Foraging
    - Gender division of labor
    - Marine and terrestial animals are diet staples

### Dogs

* Dogs were first domesticated around 18,000 years ago; longstanding importance to humans
* Dogs play a significant role in the economic and emotional wellbeing of humans

## Horticulture

* Raising crops using hand tools
* Variety of foods grown (corn, yams, bananas, etc.)
* Crop yeilds support denser populations than foraging and allow for permanent settlements
* Requirement for fallowing to provide sustainability and advancment within a community

* Five stages of horticulture
  1. Clearing
  2. Planting
  3. Weeding
  4. Harvesting
  5. Fallowing

### Division of labor
  - Family forms the core work group
  - Children work more in horticultureal groups than any other type of economy
  - Control of distrobution beyond the family gives power
  - Use rights allow families to put claims on land they cultivate increasing inequality and lucrative gains for the family

### Sustainability of horticulture
  - Highly sustainable as long as fallowing system is in place and population overcrowing does not exist
  - Under threat from outsiders who want the land for ranches and urban development and dam rivers to provide power for citires

> Fallowing ~ Alowing soil to recover from pervious harvest and regain its nutrients to be ready to grow the next harvest crops; sustainable process in horticultural practices

## Pastoralism

* reliand on procudts of domesticated animal herd
* Animal products provide over half of group's diet
* Distance travelled distinguishes different pastoral groups

### Division of labor
  - Little overlap between gender labor roles
  - Men herd
  - Women process animal products
  - **Navaho** is a unique population where the roles are reversed
  - Children can help herd as well

* Characteristics of pastoralism
  - Spatial mobility
  - Group autonomy
  - Animals as private property
  - User rights regulate pastureland ownership
  
### Sustainability of pastoralism
  - Sustainability system ig outside forces do not encroach on herding lands and water sources
  - At risk in contemporary times due to encroachment, environmental change, country boundaries

## Agriculture

* Intensive strategy for production
  - More labor, use of fertalizers, control of water supple, use of animals
* Requires and promotes permanent settlements
* Allows for high population density
* **We speak as this area as the DAWN OF CIVILIZATION**
* Occured during the neolithic period

* Two types of agriculture
  1. Family farming
  2. Industral capital agriculture

### Division of labor
  - Familys are basic unit of production
  - Productive labor is often done by men
  - Role of women varrys from culture to culture

* Why do men dominate, three hypotheses?
  - Men and plowing: men are physically stronger and better capable for farming tasks
  - Women and child care: women are not involved in heavy labor as it would interfear with child care
  - Women and food processing: women often have responsibility for processing products near the home
* **Agriculture coincides with the ownership of private property**

### Sustainability of Agriculture
  - Not sustainable as typically practiced
  - Heavy captical outputs and need for nonrenewable resources
  - Especially true of industrial agriculture as they farm for profits and high proffit margins
  - The less sustainable a farmer is the more lucrative the profits
