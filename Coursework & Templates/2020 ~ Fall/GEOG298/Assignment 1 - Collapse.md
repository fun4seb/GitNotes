# Video Notes: Why Societies Collapse - Jared Diamond
- Some societies are more fragile than other societies; societies often collapse for environmental reasons

- 5 Point Checklist of factors that lead to collapse:
	1. Human impact on the environment; people destroying the resource space on which their depend
	2. Climate change
	3. Compromised Relations with friendly neighboring societies that previously aided in sustaining the society
	4. Relations with hostile societies
	5. Political, economic, social, and cultural factors in a society that make it more likely to solve its problems

- A society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power
	- The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, resource consumption, and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources
		- This is seen with the roman empire as the endless expansion of their empire leads to peak power right before collapse. The empire must reach peak power because peak power (overexpendature of resources and might) is what brought abbout collapse

- Why do societies not perceive their impact on the environment and stop habits in time?
	- Collapse is likely where there is a conflict of interests between the short term interests of the decision-making elites and the long term interests of the society as a whole, especially if the elites are able to isolate themselves from the consequences of their actions; whats good in the short term for the elites, is bad in the long term for the society
	- Collapse is also likely when societies are unable to make good decisions due to a conflict between strongly held values that are good in many circumstances, yet bad in other circumstances

- Idea of "time bombs"; problems that must be solved in a window of time to avoid grave consequences

# Collapsed Society 1: Greenland Norse
- **Checklist:**
	1. **Environmental impact:** The Norse inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation
		- This was a problem because they depended on forests to create charcoal and then to create iron. This left them as an iron-age society unable to produce their own iron.
	2. **Climate change:** In Greenland the climate got significantly colder in the 1300's and especially so in the 1400's ("Little Ice Age")
	3. **Compromised friendly relations:** The Greenland Norse traded with their mother-country of Norway however this relation dwindled partly due to the weakening of Norway as well as the obstruction of trade routes due to sea ice as a result of climate change
	4. **Relations with hostile societies:** The Greenland Norse had a hostile relationship with the Inuit who they shared the island with; the Inuit killed many Norse peoples and notable blocked access to fjords which the Norsemen depended on for seals
	5. **Political, economic, cultural, and social factors:** The Norse were dedication to a Christian society investing heavily in the construction of churches, they were a competitive ranked society based around chiefdom who mainly looked after their own short-term interests, they were irrationally reluctant to eat fish, and refused to learn from the Inuit who had a great wealth of survival knowledge related to the environment and especailly the climate of which they had low opinions of
		- The refusal to learn from the Inuit is a significant point because the Inuit were much better experienced in the colder climate and had many survival techniques such as kayak navigation and general knowledge that was not shared with the Norse due to the ignorance of the Norse, their aversion to learning from the Inuit, and their overall hostile relationship

# Collapsed Society 2:

# Essay Outline
- first compare the checklist of both societies, outline the similarities and differences
- how did both societies not see impending collapse? outline the similarities in governance/power structures as well as the similar dynamic of conflicting interests between leaders and citizens
	- Emperors and chieftains both tend towards the over-accumulation of resources, be that food stores, land, military power etc. this over-accumulation leads to a society reaching peak power and then failure to support this peak power leading to collapse. societies fail to support their peak power because the resources and stability needed to support a system at such a scale were exploited to reach that power in the first place; rapid growth leads to rapid instability
- Outline how the societies may have been affected by very different outside stimulus however the prevalence of that stimulus was the result of very similar governance and motive
- Talk about path dependency and feedback loops related to the roman expansion; once on the course for mass expansion and growth of the empire it cannot easily be stopped.
	- The expansion of the empire can be seen as a feedback loop as the conquering of neighboring states to provide much needed resources to support an endlessly growing population lead to prosperity, which leads to more population growth, which then makes the further conquering and assimilation of new resources vital to the stability of the empire.
- Concept of regime shift of systems and how a regime shift for human societies entails a shift from a stable society to a collapsed one
- In the context of the Greenland Norse, the regions of the Western and Eastern settlements of the Norse, experienced regime shift from a state of resting and inaction, to a state of growth and development as a result of the actions. For example the soil erosion and deforestation that resulted from the overuse of the land marked a more traditional ecological regime shift from a healthy fertile land to an infertile one that had direct consequences affecting the resilience of the Norse settlements and contributed to the collapse of the system as a whole. One can now see how all systems exist within a hierarchy of other systems and no one system is immune to the forces of other systems with which space is shared, especially from the perspective of systems of nature conflicting with systems of man. In the context of the Roman Empire...
