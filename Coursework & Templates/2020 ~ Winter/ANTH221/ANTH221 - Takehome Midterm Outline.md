## Introduction

### Hook
Symbols are often deceptively complex, much like humans. Symbols exist as an integral part of human culture and are found concurrently across all cultures in the form of rituals, practices, and iconography just to name a few.

### Thesis
Symbolic meanings are determined not solely by nature of biology but by the certainty of culture across humanity that acts as a lens for which all humans consume the world with.

Symbolic interpretations are determined by the culture of those interacting with such symbols rather than being determined solely by nature. Such an argument contradicts the fact that symbols exist universally throughout the human world despite any one symbol lacking a universal interpretation. Clifford Geertz makes the point that someones biological constitution is equally a product of culture as well as biological nature.

### Evidence
> What makes the above correct

"Another very important point in this selection is that man's biological constitution is as much a product of his capacity for culture as his capacity for culture is a product of his biological nature. Geertz maintains that culture is not a characteristic of man that was superimposed on his biological structure; instead,biological and cultural evolution went hand in hand and the development of human culture contributed greatly to the direction of human biological evolution. In these terms, man's capacity for the symbolic organization of life and his biological constitution are to be seen as aspects of each other rather than as opposed processes." (Geertz, 17)

Geertz argues that the human interpretation of symbols is not influenced by biology or culture alone, but a mix of the two as both influence key parts of human life, To overvalue one over the other is problematic for reasons that will be explained below. Culture is the lens in which everyone experiences the world around them. One's environment is filtered through their own individual culture as it exists within a collective, leading any one symbol to lack a universal interpretation. To utilize a reductionist approach and argue that nature solely determines the interpretation of symbols fails to realize that symbolic interpretations of biology are not universal despite human biological characteristics being generally universal themselves. Therefore according to the logic of someone to make this argument, the symbolic interpretations held by people cross-culturally should be identical however in reality this is not the case as is seen with the cultural understanding of gender being ultimately rooted from an understanding of biological sex that is interpreted and stratified into a cultural understanding of gendered characteristics, stemming from biological attributes, that is not constant cross-culturally. This is seen with the existence of three gendered systems within cultures such as the Hijras group who are officially recognized as a third gender in countries within the Indian subcontinent, being considered neither completely male nor female. The example of India's third gender shows how different cultures can interpret and mediate the same biological influences and produce different symbolic understandings of a topic. A symbolic anthropologist could argue that due to this the development and mediation of symbols must be viable and influenced from a variety of factors that are not constant universally, this statement would agree with the notion that symbols exist as polysemous entities. 

### Link
> How this point links to the next paragraph; a satisfying concluding couple sentences to end off the paragraph nicely

While statements such as "humans mediate biology through symbols" may be true, many anthropologists would argue that they do not effectively explain the contemporary ritual and what it deeply means to people adequately enough to be accepted as fact; it is simply a secondary rationalization.

## Conclusion

### Restate Thesis
To reduce a symbols underlying meaning to any singular absolute fact disregards the complexity symbols are understood to have and fails to observe the nuance of semiotic cultural understanding.

### Restate Key Points & Evidence
It is entirely possible and likely that nature is a sizable factor in the interpretation of many biological subjects as symbols. Despite this such thought assumes that symbols are simple enough to be linearly influenced by singular factors such as nature, or materialism, or any other secondary rationalization that denies the undeniable polysemic characteristics of symbols that exist consistently cross-culturally.

### Closing Sentence
Reducing the rationalization of cultural practices surrounding symbolism is seen to be clearly problematic not only from a realistically social perspective, but from an underlying logical standpoint based on some clear certainties regarding the behavior of symbols that break down when scaled to such absolutist certainties.

## Introduction

### Hook
To reduce symbols to simple secondary rationalizations is to undermine the complexity and nuance of symbols as a form of characteristically human communication.

### Thesis
Cultural materialism, functionalism, structuralism, and other similar anthropological approaches that argue in favor of a  reductionist approach to semiotics, fails to fully understand the nuance of symbolic practices to accurately explain their existence and cultivation within all cultures.

### Point
> What I am about to say and how it links to the question or title

What Mary Douglas has exemplified throughout her criticisms of the materialist and other reductionist approaches (Lecture 2, Slide 54), as well as being emphasized within course lectures, is the fact that reductionist schools of thought such as cultural materialism under Harris leads to secondary rationalizations that fail to grasp the depth any particular symbol inherently has.

### Evidence
> What makes the above correct

"As Mary Douglas points out, our own categories and experience often affect how we view and categorize other peopleâ€™s symbols... Douglas says that instead symbols must be understood in cultural context, and as part of complex system of signification" (Lecture 2, slide 55)

### Expand

This mention of understanding symbols as a "complex system of signification" is an incredible important concept to grasp when one is looking to accurately interpret symbolic meanings. It can be understood as many often deeply culturally influenced factors that contribute to a symbol encompassing a very complex meaning that is tied to the context it is situated in. One could say that the idea that symbols must be understood within their context is evidence of a symbols meaning and interpretation among the cultural consumers of the symbol having the ability to develop over time as context is ever-changing. An example of a cultural consumer of symbols could be as simple as someones participation within a school environment as a student that exemplifies all the symbolic connotations that surround being a student and existing as a symbol for public education.

## Body 2

### Point
> What I am about to say and how it links to the question or title

Interpretations often cited as reductionist are not without merit or consideration, but as Mary Douglas remarks in her book Purity and Danger, they must not neglect the inference of other complimentary approaches to reach a more conclusive symbolic and culturally mindful explanation.

### Evidence
> What makes the above correct

"So much for medical materialism, a term coined by William James for the tendency to account for religious experience in these terms: for instance, a vision or dream is explained as due to drugs or indigestion. There is no objection to this approach unless it excludes other interpretations." (Douglas, 33)

Identifying one-sided, reductionist thought and understanding the issues with such ways of rationalizing symbolic practices is extremely important to uncovering a well-thought and comprehensive explanation for any symbolic interaction. While cultural materialism is an important perspective to consider when rationalizing the behavior and persistence of symbols within a given collective culture or society. The problem with reductionist thinking is that it is seeking to explain deeply nuanced symbolic practices by funneling the possible motivations of symbolic practices through a material dependent approach when such symbolic occurrence cannot be boiled down so easily; Cultural materialist are looking to reduce symbols to specifically material means first and formulate an accurate statement regarding the underlying factors for any given symbol second.

## Conclusion

### Restate Thesis
Reductionist rationalizations such as cultural materialism, functionalism,Cultural materialism as explored by Marvin Harris' and critiqued by Mary Douglas reduces the relationship between symbol and meaning to a one-dimensional secondary rationalization that struggles to fully encompass not only the origin of any particular symbol but the ways in which the symbol is understood are used on a social and cultural level. Cultural materialism fails to capture the true meaning a symbol possess' within the mind of those consuming and sharing the symbol.

### Restate Key Points & Evidence
Symbolic anthropologist are ultimately interested in the underlying meaning of any particular symbol, a meaning that is culturally cultivated, subjective, and unable to be reduced to structures, functions, materiality, history, psychology and any other way of thinking. These interpretations consistently lack flexibility and deal in logically problematic absolutes in its arguments.

### Closing Sentence
Semiotics requires an in-depth and multifaceted approach to achieve contextual understanding of even relatively simple symbols and such problematic schools of thought specifically characterize themselves with contradicting this and searching for singular underlying causalities that when one over-utilizes such thought lack balanced and socially reasonable symbolic explanations that are required to reach such profound conclusions.
