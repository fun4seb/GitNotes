# Auto-Ethnography Outline

# Introduction
Video games; a pastime often not taken seriously by the general public compared to competing industries such as the film or music industry. Video games are often seen as the antithesis to the notion of "time well spent" yet they hold such a prominent place in pop culture regardless. Such other media industries see engagement from all demographics, only varying in the specificity of the content, however video games as a leisure practice find the vast majority of its engagement from a less than diverse audience, largely young middle class men aged 18-35. Now this is due to a compounding host of social issues and decades of increasingly targeted marketing that could fill many more papers, however this paper in particular is to explore my personal leisure practice of choice, online gaming. Online video gaming as a leisure practice can be analyzed through the understanding of sociological concepts such as constraints and affordances, burnout, and emotional intelligence.

# Body 1: My Life in Context
Before being able to understand my leisure practices through the lens of the sociological concepts covered in class it is important that i provide some preliminary information regarding my life inside the context of society. My name is Sebastian Bursey and i was born to a heterosexual couple as one of four. I had a typical middle class childhood, free of financial stress with just enough money to be able to comfortably pursue hobbies and extra curriculars such as hockey and the relevant video games that consumed much of my adolescent free time. I love video games and they have gone from a way to maintain social relationships, waste time, provide escape, and back again countless times. For most of my life they have held a comfortingly constant presence in my lifestyle as much of the world changed around me through the years. My school nights consisted of parting ways with my classmates only to rejoin them forty five minutes later in a Skype call to play four to five hours of the newly released Minecraft. It was certainly unhealthy and lacked moderation leading to problems of which will be discussed later, but it is the primary leisure practice that characterized my time and by extension my life. It is important to note the great benefit i feel video games have had in my life. I often spent hours each night in a constant state of flow, always being thrusted a new virtual goal to be satisfied striving for, achieving, and repeating in a constant gameplay loop that characterizes most online games. If there is anything video games do well it is making overly accessible goals seem extremely fulfilling and satisfying to the largest player-base possible.

# Body 2: Constraints & Affordances
Like every other individual in society i am born with personal constraints and affordances that either nurture or limit my capabilities within society. Growing up middle class I was lucky enough to be afforded access to the disposable income of my parents who in turn allowed me to purchase in moderation things to populate my leisure time, this often meant i could obtain a new video game by the time my birthday or Christmas came around. Other key affordances of mine that contribute to my continued participation in online gaming as a leisure practice include my location, being situated in a country with adequate internet allows me to not be limited by locations technological infrastructure.

## Constraints: Disposable Income
As with many hobbies, a financial commitment is required to participate. In the case of gaming it comes in the form of often expensive computer hardware or game consoles as well as the game copies themselves, of which players can spend fortunes on. These costs serve as a barrier to entry, (even once obtained, the quality of the equipment/hardware itself can limit ones performance) and as a result ones lack of disposable income to spend on personal leisure pursuits such as video games can be understood as a constraint. This was a constraint that I personally experienced as I have never had access to a desirably powerful enough computer to adequately run the video games my friends were playing and never prioritized such a purchase as many of my friends spent thousands on the latest computer hardware to stay up to date with every new release. As a result the games running on my laptop ran poorly, limiting my personal performance as a player through technical limitations.

## Affordances: Free Time
In order for the waves of online games that hit the market every year to profit successfully in the long term they must have effective, and often malicious, strategies or design choices to keep the players attention and ensure they always return for the next round. There is always a new match to be won or milestone to achieve or any other host of reasons to keep players playing and providing business in the form of clicks, engagement, and micro-transactions. On top of this the game designers understand that there needs to be some form of mastery required to excel and incentivize long stretches of playing in order to improve to more effectively dominate ones opponents. In other words there is a hefty time commitment required to adequately master each games layers of systems and mechanics. Growing up i had plentiful amounts of free time due to rarely receiving homework year after year, as well as parents that respected my wishes to spend my leisure time as i saw fit. In other words I had the affordance of time, something working and more publicly socially active were contrained in. This resulted in hours of my time daily being spent online, shut out from the world only to thrive in one made of ones and zeroes.

# Body 3: Burnout
Online gaming is an extremely lucrative industry, the longer they can keep players attention over the long term the more money is made. Due to this the gameplay structure of each game is extremely addictive by design and continuous play is rewarded. Devoting hours and mental energy each day is incentivized and the tendency for burnout is not only a common occurrence, but something most players experience at some point. This was the case with not only me but most people I knew who were at one point devoted to such games. The problem lies in the fact players are meant to feel obligated to keep playing, as if they are disadvantaged or missing out by not participating. This is done through seasonal events, limited time exclusive collectables, and content updates just to name a few. This obligation many players feel to keep playing leads them to commit absorband amounts of their leisure time in order to stay relavent and competitive within the multiplayer scene. I experienced video game burnout firsthand after spending nearly everyday of the summer before university playing the popular team-based competitive game Leugue of Legends. My growing dissilusionment with the game due to a lack of moderation led to feelings of resentment of other players, the game company, and myself for repeatedly practicing the act of insanity until finally i decided a break was required, effectivley resulting in burnout. 

# Body 4: Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence is extremely relevant when trying to understand the impact that extended periods of online gaming has on the mind. Online gaming is uniquely social compared to other genres of games and the prolonged exposure to other players with opposing objectives has the tendency to bring out the worst in many. The common stereotype of the "toxic gamer" is not only prevalent but extremely common; basement dwelling, misogynistic, short tempered and often emotionally underdeveloped.
