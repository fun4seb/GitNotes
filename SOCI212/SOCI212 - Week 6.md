# SOCI212 - Week 6

## From Last Class

* Outliers/extreme scores cause skewness; if skewed use median as it produces a less distorted representation

## Dispersion

> Dispersion = Variety, Diversity, amount of variation between score

### Examples of Dispersion

* A large city will have more ethnic diversity than a small town
* Some cities are more linguistically diverse than others
* Some students are more consistent with their study hours than others
* Some students have different or same ages

### Dispersion graphed

* Taller curve has less dispersion, flatter curve has more dispersion

## Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV)

* IQV value is a ratio from 0-1 where 0 means absolutely no variability and 1 means maximum variability
* Essentially the "ratio of the amount of variation actually observed"
* Rarely used
* Only measure of dispersion for nominal-level variables

## Range (R)

> Range (R) = High Score - Low Score

* Range can also be misleading much like mean

## Interquartile Range (Q)

> Interquartile Range (Q) = Score at 75% - Score at 25%

* Avoids problems of R by focusing only on the middle 50% of scores
* Difference between the scores of the case situated at 25% (first quartile) of the distribution and the case situated at 75% (third quartile) of the distribution

## Standard Deviation

> Deviation is spread/dispersion between any score in a distribution and the mean

* Standard deviation is the average size of all the deviations in the distribution
* Most important and widely used measure of dispersion
* Should be used with interbal-ratio variables but is often used with ordinal-level variables
* Uses all scores in the distribution unlike Q and R which are based on 2 scores
