# Week 7: Class & Inequality	

## Content

- Pierre Bourdieu: "The Forms of Capital"
- Annette Lareau: “Cultural Knowledge and Social Inequality”
- Movie: The Up Series (1964-today)

## Bordieu

- 3 fundamental types of capital:
	1. Economic ~ Financial assets; converted into currency
		- Ex: Property rights
	2. Cultural ~ Cultural habits; dispositions and knowledge; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Educational Qualifications
	3. Social ~ Who you know; social networks; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Titles of nobility
- Economic studies only consider monetary investment and fail to consider the domestic transmission of cultural capital
- Cultural capital = knowledge (what you know) + know-how (knowing when/how to use what you know
	- Cultural capital is obtained through early socialization
- Cultural capital has 3 forms:
	1. Embodied state ~ long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body, personal investment/"work on oneself", declines and dies with its bearer
	2. Objectified state ~ Cultural goods which are the trace or realization of theories or critiques of these theories/problematics, transmissible in its materiality, appropriable materially and symbolically 
	3. Institutionalized state ~ form of objectification BUT it confers  entirely original property on the cultural capital which it is presumed to guarantee, qualification which can be exchanged on the labor market for monetary value
- Social capital = membership in a group, collectivity-owned capital, "the profits which accrue from membership in a group are the basic of the solidarity which makes them possible", exchange, mutual knowledge, 	recognition, presence of a spokesperson who is the head of the group

## Lareau

- Links Bordieu (unevenness of rewards)
- Most academic studies focus on academic skill and big significant moments, Lareau's study is longitudinal (like Up series) in order to better capture the evolution of every participant over the years from childhood to adulthood
- Middle-class children are over dependent on parents but more knowledgeable and likely to get what they want compaired to lower-class students. Middle-class children also aquired better careers than lower-class kids by age 30
- Parents' social origins influence their childrens lives; they pass on cultural capital which helps their children navigate institutions
- Overall middle-class students display in every sphere of everyday life a...
	1. Thorough knowledge of the "rules of the game"
	2. A sense of entitlement
	3. Ability to have their needs met
- Economic resources = large issue
- Cultural capital = skills individuals inherit that can be translated into different forms of value as people move through different institutions
- **Social class shapes educational exerience**
- There is a set of "rules" by which academic institutions operate and working-class + poor students have little knowledge of these rules (shyness, unawareness of class policies, incapacity to get school to adjust itself to their person needs - missing "habits of resourcefulness")
- Lack of cultural knowledge, bureaucratic struggles, unaweness of key components

## Film Context: The Up Series

- British documentary series; follows the lives of 14 British kids from various socioeconomic backgrounds; children are 7 in 1964 at the start of the series, "Seven Up!"
- The films wanted to “get a glimpse” of the British population in the year 2000 by following the different stages leading up to adulthood
- Upper-class participants:​ Andrew, Charles, John (wealthy neighbourhood, pre-prep), Suzy (private school), Nick (from rural area), Bruce (prestigious boarding school)
- Middle-class participants:​ Peter, Neil (middle-class Liverpool)
- Working-class participants:​ Lynn, Sue, Jackie (east London), Tony (London’s East Side), Paul, Symon (charity home)

# Week 8: Race & Ethnicity

## Content

- Stuart Hall: "The Whites of their Eyes: Racist Ideologies and the Media"
- Michelle Raheja: "Reading Nanook's Smile"
- Movie: Atanarnajuat (The Fast Runner) (2001)
- Short Clip: Nanook of the North (1922)

## Hall

- Representation is problematic because ideologies are problematicl ideologies are "the framework through which (societies) represent, interpret, understand, and "make sense" of some aspect of social existence" (Hall 2003:89)
- Media = transformation and production of ideologies; representation of the social world, images, descriptions, explanation, frames for udnerstanding how the world is/works
- Language = principal medium through which we express ideologies
- 3 concepts about ideologies:
	1. "Ideologies do not consist of isolated and seperate concepts, but in the articulation of different elements into a distinctive set or chain of meanings"
		- Ex: "Freedom" isn't the same to liberals as it is to socialists
	2. "Ideological statements are made by individuals: but ideologies are not the product of individual conciousness or intention. Rather we formulate out intentions within an ideology" - individuals are born into a certain ideological climate - ideologies should be transofrmed collectively and unconsciously;
	3. "Ideologies "work" by constructing for their subjects (individual or collective) positions of identification and knowledge which allow them to "utter" ideological truths as if they were their authentic authors" - we find outselves mirrored in ideologies, they "make sense"
- Inferential racism = apparently naturalized representations relating to racem unquestioned assumptions
- Mistakes the media makes: trying to remedy "race relations" but speaking as if black people are the only problem, stereotypes such as "the adventurous white man", "the slave-figure" (which is childlike and limited), "the native" (savage, barbaric, primitive)
- Ambivalent; "the double vision of the white eye through which they are seen"; to this day certain ethnicities are still perceived as "primitive"

## Raheja

- "Disempowering structures of cinematic dominance and stereotype"
- Atarnajuat (The Fast Runner) was released in 2000 and is the first full-length feature film made by an entirely Inuit crew
- **Visual sovereignty** = "creative act of self-representation that has the potential to both undermine stereotypes of indigenous peoples and to strengthen what Rovert Warrior has called the "intellectual health" of communities in the wake of genocide and colonialism."; it is reclaiming governance, control, self-representation in any and all visual platforms in order to accurately portray one's people
	- **Essentially control over ones visual reprentation in the media; In the case of Atarnajuat this is achieved through a full cast of Inuit that have complete control over their own portrayal in their own film**
- Participation of indigenous people in order to achieve self-representation = key to empowerment
- Native Americans have no single shared culture; sovereignty is the one thing which unites them - "sovereignty is an ontological and philisophical concept with very real practical, political, and cultural ramifications that unites the experiences of Native Americans, but it is a difficult idea to define because it is always in motion and is inherently contradictory."
- Igloolik Isuma Productions Inc. = didactic, offers economic opportunities, brings together the older and younger generation
- "Decolonizing space" = embracing Native American culture and getting rid of ethnocentric critiques
- Anthropologists = recognized among the Native American community as non objective and biased
	- Ex: Salvage anthropology is contradictory because it sets forth the idea that certain cultures were becoming inauthentic, impure or irrelevant
- "Hollywood Indians": Native American actors were uncredited, underpaid, and only an accessory for the white antagonist (demeaning roles)

## Film Context: Atanarjuat

- 2001; Canadian film
- Produced by an entirely Inuit collective (Isuma Igloolik Productions)
- Won Caméra d’or at Cannes (2001)
- Filmed in Nunavut
- Filming techniques and line delivery different than how Hollywood portrays Native Americans; this shows the difference between the western and the indigenous lens
- Atanarjuat: "legend of power, intrigue, love, jealousy, murder, and revenge" more than 1000 years old!
- Neither the protagonist nor the antagonist are wholly "good" or "evil"; "shamanistic narrative framework"; "pre-European invasion"; violence vs. humor

> "(...) incorporates and reworks ethnographic elements to offer up a corrective cultural narrative to combat a century of anthropological monographs and documents"

- "Nanooks smile" = example of an ethnocentric portrayal of Native American people’s; Nanook is seen as a savage because he doesn’t understand technology but Native American viewers interpret his smile completely differently (not childish, but implying sort of an inside joke)
