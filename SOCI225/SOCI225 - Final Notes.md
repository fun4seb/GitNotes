# Week 7: Class & Inequality	

## Content

- Pierre Bourdieu: "The Forms of Capital"
- Annette Lareau: “Cultural Knowledge and Social Inequality”
- Movie: The Up Series (1964-today)

## Bordieu: Capital

- 3 fundamental types of capital:
	1. Economic ~ Financial assets; converted into currency
		- Ex: Property rights
	2. Cultural ~ Cultural habits; dispositions and knowledge; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Educational Qualifications
	3. Social ~ Who you know; social networks; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Titles of nobility
- Economic studies only consider monetary investment and fail to consider the domestic transmission of cultural capital
- Cultural capital = knowledge (what you know) + know-how (knowing when/how to use what you know
	- Cultural capital is obtained through early socialization
- Cultural capital has 3 forms:
	1. Embodied state ~ long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body, personal investment/"work on oneself", declines and dies with its bearer
	2. Objectified state ~ Cultural goods which are the trace or realization of theories or critiques of these theories/problematics, transmissible in its materiality, appropriable materially and symbolically 
	3. Institutionalized state ~ form of objectification BUT it confers  entirely original property on the cultural capital which it is presumed to guarantee, qualification which can be exchanged on the labor market for monetary value
- Social capital = membership in a group, collectivity-owned capital, "the profits which accrue from membership in a group are the basic of the solidarity which makes them possible", exchange, mutual knowledge, 	recognition, presence of a spokesperson who is the head of the group

## Lareau: Class & Childhood Development

- Links Bordieu (unevenness of rewards)
- Most academic studies focus on academic skill and big significant moments, Lareau's study is longitudinal (like Up series) in order to better capture the evolution of every participant over the years from childhood to adulthood
- Middle-class children are over dependent on parents but more knowledgeable and likely to get what they want compared to lower-class students. Middle-class children also acquired better careers than lower-class kids by age 30
- Parents' social origins influence their children's lives; they pass on cultural capital which helps their children navigate institutions
- Overall middle-class students display in every sphere of everyday life a...
	1. Thorough knowledge of the "rules of the game"
	2. A sense of entitlement
	3. Ability to have their needs met
- Economic resources = large issue
- Cultural capital = skills individuals inherit that can be translated into different forms of value as people move through different institutions
- **Social class shapes educational exerience**
- There is a set of "rules" by which academic institutions operate and working-class + poor students have little knowledge of these rules (shyness, unawareness of class policies, incapacity to get school to adjust itself to their person needs - missing "habits of resourcefulness")
- Lack of cultural knowledge, bureaucratic struggles, unawareness of key components

## Film Context: The Up Series

- British documentary series; follows the lives of 14 British kids from various socioeconomic backgrounds; children are 7 in 1964 at the start of the series, "Seven Up!"
- The films wanted to “get a glimpse” of the British population in the year 2000 by following the different stages leading up to adulthood
- Upper-class participants:​ Andrew, Charles, John (wealthy neighborhood, pre-prep), Suzy (private school), Nick (from rural area), Bruce (prestigious boarding school)
- Middle-class participants:​ Peter, Neil (middle-class Liverpool)
- Working-class participants:​ Lynn, Sue, Jackie (east London), Tony (London’s East Side), Paul, Symon (charity home)

# Week 8: Race & Ethnicity

## Content

- Stuart Hall: "The Whites of their Eyes: Racist Ideologies and the Media"
- Michelle Raheja: "Reading Nanook's Smile"
- Movie: Atanarnajuat (The Fast Runner) (2001)
- Short Clip: Nanook of the North (1922)

## Hall: Ideology & Media

> Ideology ~ Group of shared ideas that are beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of a given society

- Representation is problematic because ideologies are problematic ideologies are "the framework through which (societies) represent, interpret, understand, and "make sense" of some aspect of social existence" (Hall 2003:89)
- Media = transformation and production of ideologies; representation of the social world, images, descriptions, explanation, frames for understanding how the world is/works
- Language = principal medium through which we express ideologies
- 3 concepts about ideologies:
	1. "Ideologies do not consist of isolated and separate concepts, but in the articulation of different elements into a distinctive set or chain of meanings"
		- Ex: "Freedom" isn't the same to liberals as it is to socialists
	2. "Ideological statements are made by individuals: but ideologies are not the product of individual consciousness or intention. Rather we formulate out intentions within an ideology" - individuals are born into a certain ideological climate - ideologies should be transformed collectively and unconsciously;
	3. "Ideologies "work" by constructing for their subjects (individual or collective) positions of identification and knowledge which allow them to "utter" ideological truths as if they were their authentic authors" - we find ourselves mirrored in ideologies, they "make sense"
- Inferential racism = apparently naturalized representations relating to race unquestioned assumptions
- Mistakes the media makes: trying to remedy "race relations" but speaking as if black people are the only problem, stereotypes such as "the adventurous white man", "the slave-figure" (which is childlike and limited), "the native" (savage, barbaric, primitive)
- Ambivalent; "the double vision of the white eye through which they are seen"; to this day certain ethnicities are still perceived as "primitive"

## Raheja: Visual Sovereignty

> Visual Sovereignty ~ having control over your representation within visual media

- A way to reclaim self-representations in visual platforms
- Different meanings for different audiences
- Using Inuit aesthetics and storytelling (example: Atanarjuat)
- Challenges the audience to think differently about Inuit
  - puts the viewer inside the action and inside the shoes of the Inuit

- "Disempowering structures of cinematic dominance and stereotype"
- **Visual sovereignty** = "creative act of self-representation that has the potential to both undermine stereotypes of indigenous peoples and to strengthen what Rovert Warrior has called the "intellectual health" of communities in the wake of genocide and colonialism."; it is reclaiming governance, control, self-representation in any and all visual platforms in order to accurately portray one's people
	- **Essentially control over ones visual reprentation in the media; In the case of Atarnajuat this is achieved through a full cast of Inuit that have complete control over their own portrayal in their own film**
- Participation of indigenous people in order to achieve self-representation = key to empowerment
- Native Americans have no single shared culture; sovereignty is the one thing which unites them - "sovereignty is an ontological and philosophical concept with very real practical, political, and cultural ramifications that unites the experiences of Native Americans, but it is a difficult idea to define because it is always in motion and is inherently contradictory."
- Igloolik Isuma Productions Inc. = didactic, offers economic opportunities, brings together the older and younger generation
- "Decolonizing space" = embracing Native American culture and getting rid of ethnocentric critiques
- Anthropologists = recognized among the Native American community as non objective and biased
	- Ex: Salvage anthropology is contradictory because it sets forth the idea that certain cultures were becoming inauthentic, impure or irrelevant
- "Hollywood Indians": Native American actors were uncredited, underpaid, and only an accessory for the white antagonist (demeaning roles)

## Film Context: Atanarjuat

- Atarnajuat (The Fast Runner) was released in 2000 and is the first full-length feature film made by an entirely Inuit crew
- Won Caméra d’or at Cannes (2001)
- Filmed in Nunavut
- Filming techniques and line delivery different than how Hollywood portrays Native Americans; this shows the difference between the western and the indigenous lens
- Atanarjuat: "legend of power, intrigue, love, jealousy, murder, and revenge" more than 1000 years old!
- Neither the protagonist nor the antagonist are wholly "good" or "evil"; "shamanistic narrative framework"; "pre-European invasion"; violence vs. humor

> "(...) incorporates and reworks ethnographic elements to offer up a corrective cultural narrative to combat a century of anthropological monographs and documents"

## Film Context: Nanook of the North

- While highly praised it presents alot of missinformation to sell the view as the "primative" indian, hunting with spears and disconnected from the modern world. Examples of this include:
  - Suggesting the Inuit only hunt with harpoon while they would have been using guns
  - Using language to suggest how mystifyied the eskimo are of the "white man" (saying they call the trading post the "big igloo")

- "Nanooks smile" = example of an ethnocentric portrayal of Native American people’s; Nanook is seen as a savage because he doesn’t understand technology but Native American viewers interpret his smile completely differently (not childish, but implying sort of an inside joke)

# Week 9: Gender & Sexuality

## Content

- Candace West and Don Zimmerman: “Doing Gender”
- Karin Martin: “Becoming a Gendered Body: Practices of Preschools”
- Movie: Billy Elliot (2000)

## West & Zimmerman: Doing Gender

- "The purpose of this article is to advance a new understanding of gender as a routine accomplishment embedded in everyday interaction. To do so entails a critical assessment of existing perspectives on sex and gender and the introduction of important distinction among sex, sex category, and gender"
- Distinction between sex, category, gender:
	- Sex = biological criteria
	- Sex category = category responding to presumed biological criteria
	- Gender = "ongoing task" to fit within sex category; however by age 5 it is fixed much like sex (West & Zimmerman 1987)
- Western perspective on sex & gender: men & women are 2 distinct entities engaging in masculine or feminine behavior and this is determined by their reproductive organs; "sex linked behaviors and traits as essential properties of individuals"
- "When human beings interact with other in their environment, they assume that each possesses an "essential nature"." (Goffman)
- Goffman believes gender roles are "optional performances" or "a socially scripted dramatization"; "conventional portrayals"
- Garfinkel and the case study of Agnes; the "ongoing task of being a woman" and how precise her performance had to be; "doing gender" but be tailored according to situations ("managing occasions")
- "Any activity can be assessed as to its womanly or manly nature"; **for one to "do gender" is unavoidable**
- "Doing gender means creating differences between girls and boys and women and men, differences that are not natural, essential, or biological" (p.137); differences reinforce the "essentialness" of gender
	- Ex: Segregation of public bathrooms (which is cultural), organized sports, or displays of difference in heterosexual couples
- Sex categories can be used to discredit participation in important career-related activities ("role conflict")
- Recruitment to gender identities is done by socialization, it starts with preschool children, who are taught that there are certain qualities valued more for each sex
	- Ex: Efficaciousness for boys and appearance for girls
- Division of labor, such as household chores, is also done according to sex
- "Gender is a powerful ideological device, which produces, reproduces, and legitimates the choices and limits that are predicated on sex category" (p.147); there are legitimate existing gender hierarchies which enable or prevent people from doing certain things

## Martin: Gendered Bodies

- Body movements depend on gender (girls are constricted in certain movements such as uncrossing legs)
- "Gendered (along with "raced" and "classed") bodies create particular contexts for social relations as they signal, manage, and negotiate information about power and status"
	- Women = anxiety, tentativeness
	- Men = confidence, power
- Hidden curriculum of school; it is a form of social control "to shape the body is to shape the mind"; everyday practices of the body reinforce and maintain gender hierarchies assumed as "natural" in our society, rather than caused by socialization
- How children are gendered:
	1. Through clothes (color, type)
	2. Through volume of their voice (loud, quiet, passive, aggressive)
	3. Through posture (slouched and comfortable, sitting upright)
- Teachers structure girl activities much more and exert more control over the volume of their voices; the girls that learn that their bodies are supposed to be quiet, small, and physically constrained; the reluctance of girls to use their voices in danger situations begins at an early age
- Preschool play is semi-segregated; this ties into teachers structuring girls' activities more; girls are often sitting down properly and doing artistic or intellectual activities (neat, quiet activities) whereas boys are often more mobile, they can sit down however they want, their play is louder and more based on cars, legos (physical)
- Cross-gender interactions are more often than not negative as opposed to same-sex interactions
- "Children also sometimes resist their bodies being gendered"; this suggests that gendered physicalities are NOT natural, but constructed through social institutions and their practices
- Preschoolers aged 3 are less gendered than those aged 5; they don't yet associate certain items of clothing to a certain gender and their play is less segregated, cross-gender interactions more harmonious
- Girls are extremely responsible and motherly from an early age, example when one's skirt hikes up another girl will be quick to fix it

## Film Context: Billy Elliot

- Set in Northern England in the early 1980s
- Billy is expected to engage in boxing just like every other guy but he hates the sport and is very bad at it
- He discovers a passion for ballet dancing which is fueled by his teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson
- His father Jackie disagrees
- Secondary themes of class conflict aside from gender roles
- Explores the idea of boys who do ballet/dance which conflicts traditional gender roles that only women can do ballet
- Billy takes care of his grandma in the house, a nurturing role usually specific to women
- Billy has an internal struggled when starting dance, worrying about being a sissy or a puff
- Ballet teacher clearly much more well off than Billy's family
- Children are much more aware than authoritative figures realize, Billy's girl ballet friend is very aware of the nuances of her parents' marital conflict ("they don't have sex", "dad did it with a lady from work" etc.)
- Billy expresses his anger and dissatisfaction with the order of things through dance during the angry dance sequence, dance is an traditionally un-manly way to express ones feelings
- Billy is uncorrupted by strict gender notions that lead him to possess compassion and empathy for breakage of traditional gender roles held by people such as his father
- Billy's fathers acceptance as well as Tony and family friend poses as a heartwarming story element it is arguably unrealistic due to the context of the time. despite this the film is still an effective representation of current opinions on gender roles in a westernized society during the 20th century.

# Week 10: Globalization, the Market, and Capitalism

## Content

- Mike Davis: "Planet of Slums"
- Peter Evans	& William Sewell: "The Neo-liberal era: Ideology, Policy, and Social Effects"
- Movie: Slumdog Millionaire (2008)

## Davis: Slums

- The rise of the middle class is not attributed to the redistribution of wealth but rather by taking even more money from the poor
- United Nations Habitat Office: 1 billion people living in slums globally
	- Slums = substandard housing, insecurity of tenure, and the absence of one or more urban services and infrastructures
- Developed countries slum population = 6% VERSUS 78.2% for developing countries
- Today vs. 19th century = slums are larger and denser, which encourages the spread of fire, disease, and other disasters
- Slums are placed on the outskirts of urban settlements; the city can't offer jobs to everyone and the countryside is used to absorb the surplus but with globalization and urbanization the countryside has become too poor
	- There are many push factors and no pull factors
- Political consequences: because of low employment rate men will do anything in order to survive (crime gangs, militia)
- Slums are prone to natural disasters because they are established on the only pieces of free land that are available (polluted, steep, unstable)
- Sanitation is the #1 problem because everyone shares the same amenities; also some people will raise animals in an effort to survive, facilitating the spread of diseases OR hunt exotic animals who carry viruses such as HIV or Ebola
- Answer to the slum challenge = self-administration; "development from below"
	- Problem: insufficient resources (wealth redistribution and jobs are a big challenge)
- "Urban employment is equal to climate change as a fundamental challenge for our future"

## Evans & Sewell: Neoliberalism & Globalization

- Neoliberalism: "(...) a rapidly integrating world market regulated by global rules administered by economic governance institutions like the World Trade Organization and disciplined by instantaneous global exchanged for currencies, securities, and bonds." (p.35)
- "Neoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human wellbeing can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedom and skills within an institution framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade." (Harvey 2005:2)
- Ways neoliberalism manifests itself:
	1. Economic theory
	2. Political ideology
	3. Policy paradigm
	4. Social imaginary
- 1970's = great postwar economic boom, 1973-1975 = stock market crash + deep recession caused by inflation ("general crisis of capitalism")
- Cultural and political climate: the youths/students vs. corporate social order and bureaucracy; movement combining socialism, egalitarianism, libertarianism, and bohemian spirit; labor activism + struggle of minority groups; environmental awareness; utopia of universal human rights
- F. A. Hayek: one of the founding fathers of neoliberalism; believed it's a mistake to think the state should do as little as possible; it should intervene actively to ensure free competition under the rule of law
- Margaret Thatcher & Ronald Reagan are powerful neoliberal leaders
- The U.S. spread neoliberalism all over the world due to its power and influence; North America = neoliberal epicenter
- 1990s were the pinacle of neoliberal dominance however that is era when the first signs of fracture started to appear
- 2008 = economic crisis, neoliberalism's contradictions come to light, protests against free trade agreements emerge amongst workers all around the globe
- Neoliberalism has a global impact but the application and chosen values are not homogenous; every continent adopted neoliberal characteristics which fit their own culture and system in place
	- Ex: France liberalized its markets because it was required by the EU and the economic situation was redeemed by turning to neoliberal practices, however France is traditionally soci-democratic
- By becoming easier and less expensive world trade, local trade resulted in international trade = GLOBALIZATION
- Peasant population in decline; "depeasantization" leads to urban slums because countryside can't absorb the population surplus anymore

## Film Context: Slumdog Millionare

- Based on a novel (“Q&A” by Swarup)
- Portrayal of the global south BUT through a western lens! This created different reactions in western audiences and indian audiences - ethnocentrism and anthropological lens
- Power imbalances in neoliberal globalized context
- Ethical issues: the children in the film are real children living in slums; they were underpaid even though the movie made enormous profits

# Week 11: Consumption & Consumer Culture

## Content

- Juliet B. Schor: “The Overspent American”
- Jean Baudrillard: “Consumer Society”
- Movie: Merchants of Cool (2001), Generation Like (2014)

## Schor: Consumption

- Consumption = identity; Americans used to buy things in order to impress/keep up with their neighbours but now items they buy are part of their identity
- Material dissatisfaction comes from the fact that lifestyle aspirations are founded on people who make much more money than the average person; advertising and media perpetuates as they are the ones directing us towards these lifestyle aspirations
- Want rapidly becomes need
- The paradox is that no one is spending lavishly, in fact people seem to be barely getting by
- Consumption = comparative, competitive, establishes social status
- Consumption through the decades:
	- 1950s: neighbourhood were the main social hotspot; everyone wanted the same belongings; consumption as a way to fit in
	- 1970s: introduction of more women into the labor force shifts the social center to the workplace; there is now a wider economic spectrum (employees vs. boss) and also the problematic difference between single paycheck and double paycheck families
	- 1980s + 1990s: faster aquisition and more upscale buying; introduction of concepts such as "the good life" and "the neccessities of life"; emergence of trend to emulate the upper scale standards sees the creation of cheaper alternatives (knockoffs); gap between social classes is expanding
- Shift of focus in the "American Dream"; goals are becoming increasingly more lavish
- The emergence of the second paycheck earner has an impact on household world and family life; parents spend less time with their children and doing chores
- Unwillingness to cut back on luxuries results in people saving little to no money; there is a rise of social problems and an assumption that we can spend our way around these problems
- Downshifting: solution found by people questioning consumerism; switching careers, turning part-time, creating home-based businesses; downshifters apear in all social classes; it is not considered a religion or a community (like hippies or quakers) but rather an orientation, a lifestyle, a balancement of values and viable reaction to society's push towards extreme materialism

## Baudrillard

- Consumption and affluence are now part of human nature; humans value objects over relationships; objects surround us and they form a system of meaning, a language
- Accumulation/profusion/luxury = ideals; displays or collections reaveal status
- Objects = arranged in paths to entice customers; always invite consumption through complimentary products; no longer need to have a utility, they are desirable just to own
- Shopping malls: the 7-day a week accessability and the new credit cards further the consumption process even more
	- Promote a **culture of consumption**
- Utility (economic notion) vs. conformity (sociological notion)
- Main idea of capitalism is to shift the constrol from the consumer to the enterprise; appropriation of social goals by an enterprise for its own personal gains; "the system of needs is the product of the system of production" (p.42)
- Key historical developments:
	- Subsistence economies are replaced by market economies (capitalism) which sees the emergence of wage labour
	- The industrial revolution (late 18th century) causes the growth of manufacturing capacity
	- The Gilded Age (late 19th century) captures the emergence of conspicuous consumption amongst elite groups
	- Then post-WW2 (early-mid 20th century) is the era of mass consumption and Fordism
- Fordism refers to the standardization of production focused on the mass market; mass production = mass consumption; commodities are standardized; the concept of standardization as a whole becomes culturally valued and is seen as a virtue because it’s synonyms with efficacity
- Today the production of goods is slowly moving away from standardization and towards unique products; even mass-produced brands adopt this ethos which was influenced by social media

## Movie Context: Merchants of Cool

- PBS Frontline documentary by Douglas Rushkoff
- Describes the world of advertising and marketing and analyses how it touches youth culture 

## Movie Context: Generation Like

- Same director; 13 years later he updates the themes explored in Merchants of Cool
- The change of trends and definition of “cool” capture the shift in consumption
- We see the evolution of generations
- Money isn’t the only currency anymore; technological advancements = likes, reblogs, retweets are now very important factors which shape our public image, much like our acquisitions

# Week 12: Food Culture

## Omnivorousness

* Bourdieu: Taste = form of cultural capital + how is it related to class position?
* The things we like, the things we do culturally produce and reproduce class
* His argument:
  - Hish culture > shows status (is related to higher classes)
  - Low/popular culture > does not demonstrate status (is related to lower classes)
* Today: more about eclecticism than what Bourdieu observed

* Cultural consuption today = more diverse
* Broadening of cultural repertoires BUT ALSO selective
* AND status is important
* Cultural capital: needed to know what types of culture are valued, and gives us status to those that are "in the know"

> Question: if people are consumer more broadly, how do they decide what is more valuable? Essentially what characteristics are they relating?

## Authenticity

- Important criterion for knowing what foods are "good" or valuable
- "Real" food
- Authenticity is socially constructed and relational
- Valuing of authenticity relates to broader class politics
  - Relate to why authenticity is valued so much in modern society

## Modern Value

- Connected to modern ideals: being tru to ones self, determinism, personal choice, etc.
- Being true to ones self, but also important to consider social side of authenticity

## Socially Constructed

- Not inherent to things - is about how things are percieved as "authentic" What are authenticity's qualities

## Geographic Security

- Foods from somehwere, not placeless foods
- Very specific references to place
- Foods that are restricted in production, like geographic indications

## Simplicity

- Honest, unprocessed, handmade
- Not too fussy
- Whole foods

## Personal Connection

- "Authentic food is about personal connection""
- Connected to someone special & creative like art is connected to artist
- Chefs, but also culinary artisans who are passing along family traditions

## History & Tradition

- History and tradition are what legitimates the food
- Cooked how is has always been cooked/how it should be cooked
- Historical tradition, usually enthno-cultural tradition
- Some creative/innovation injected into tradition makes more authentic

## Ethnic Connection

- People with ethnic connection to food make it more authentic (whether producers or consumers)

## Class Politics of Authenticity

- Key role of authenticity: helps to ease tension in contemporary culture between **democracy** and **distinction**
- Democracy = inclusiveness, equality - very important North American value
- Authenticity = opening up of tastes, thus is democratic in a way
- BUT also about distinction because produces and reproduces culinary world that is laden with hierarchies and elitism
- Deriving status from cultural consumption

# Ugly Delicious (2018)
