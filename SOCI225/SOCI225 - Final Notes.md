# Week 7: Class & Inequality	

## Content

- Pierre Bourdieu: "The Forms of Capital"
- Annette Lareau: “Cultural Knowledge and Social Inequality”
- Movie: The Up Series (1964-today)

## Bordieu

- 3 fundamental types of capital:
	1. Economic ~ Financial assets; converted into currency
		- Ex: Property rights
	2. Cultural ~ Cultural habits; dispositions and knowledge; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Educational Qualifications
	3. Social ~ Who you know; social networks; convertible under certain conditions
		- Ex: Titles of nobility
- Economic studies only consider monetary investment and fail to consider the domestic transmission of cultural capital
- Cultural capital = knowledge (what you know) + know-how (knowing when/how to use what you know
	- Cultural capital is obtained through early socialization
- Cultural capital has 3 forms:
	1. Embodied state ~ long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body, personal investment/"work on oneself", declines and dies with its bearer
	2. Objectified state ~ Cultural goods which are the trace or realization of theories or critiques of these theories/problematics, transmissible in its materiality, appropriable materially and symbolically 
	3. Institutionalized state ~ form of objectification BUT it confers  entirely original property on the cultural capital which it is presumed to guarantee, qualification which can be exchanged on the labor market for monetary value
- Social capital = membership in a group, collectivity-owned capital, "the profits which accrue from membership in a group are the basic of the solidarity which makes them possible", exchange, mutual knowledge, 	recognition, presence of a spokesperson who is the head of the group

## Lareau

- Links Bordieu (unevenness of rewards)
- Most academic studies focus on academic skill and big significant moments, Lareau's study is longitudinal (like Up series) in order to better capture the evolution of every participant over the years from childhood to adulthood
- Middle-class children are over dependent on parents but more knowledgeable and likely to get what they want compaired to lower-class students. Middle-class children also aquired better careers than lower-class kids by age 30
- Parents' social origins influence their childrens lives; they pass on cultural capital which helps their children navigate institutions
- Overall middle-class students display in every sphere of everyday life a...
	1. Thorough knowledge of the "rules of the game"
	2. A sense of entitlement
	3. Ability to have their needs met
- Economic resources = large issue
- Cultural capital = skills individuals inherit that can be translated into different forms of value as people move through different institutions
- **Social class shapes educational exerience**
- There is a set of "rules" by which academic institutions operate and working-class + poor students have little knowledge of these rules (shyness, unawareness of class policies, incapacity to get school to adjust itself to their person needs - missing "habits of resourcefulness")
- Lack of cultural knowledge, bureaucratic struggles, unaweness of key components
