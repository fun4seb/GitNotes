## Sociological Imagination

### What is it?

> Sociological Imagination ~  ability to see things socially and how they interact and influence each other. To have a sociological imagination, a person must be able to pull away from the situation and think from an alternative point of view.

* **History + Biography**
* How people fit into history
* How history influences
* Personal - larger focus
* Awareness

### Why is it Important?

Self Conciousness:
> With sociological imagination "We come to feel as if suddenly awakened in a house with which they had only supposed themselves to be familiar." (page 8)

### What are its Elements/Lens?

1. Personal Troubles
  Things that are individualized and closer to us as indivisuals, have to do with self and are individual matters/problems
2. Public Issues
  Remote to us, happen at a broader social level beyond the individual

## Big Question this Term

* Look at films as sociological case studies
* To what degree does the movie connect **biography** (individual story), **social structure** (broader social forces) and **history** (larger historical forces)

## To Kill a Mockingbird

* Based on Harper Lee noveel (1969)
* Directed by Robert Mulligan; released in 1962
* Starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a lowyer who accepts to defend a black man who was accused of raping a white girl
* Set in 1920s Alabama, Jim Crow south

### Questions to think about?

* How does To Kill a Mocking Bird help us understand the sociological imagination?
* How does the film help us understand the sociological "project" more broadly?

Films Notes:
* Walter does not acknowledge the black maid
