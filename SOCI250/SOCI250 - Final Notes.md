# Week 5 - Creating Culture (Chapter 3)

## Durkheim & Social Production of Culture

- Durkheim observed modern people can be sorted in many ways (jobs, beliefs, life experiences)
	- This is called organic solidarity and contrasts mechanical solidarity in which everyone performs similar tasks and have similar life experiences (everyone is interchangable)

## Durkheim & Role of Religion

- Durkheim viewed religion as the most fundamental bond between people of earlier times
- Durkheim's analysis on religion centers on 4 key ideas:
	1. Collective representation
	2. Distrinction between sacred & profane
	3. Origins of the sacred
	4. Social consequences of religion
- He argued religion provided the foundation for all "categories of thinking"; "collective representations which express collective realities"
	- Durkheim makes this point by bringing up the organization of time as a social contruct as a collective reality (A specific example is the 7-day week convention of western societies)
- Humans are "double", we possess an individual biological component and a shared social component our participation in a collective consciousness—and our categories of thought, including our sense of the religious, come from that second social component. Hence, religion and culture are collective representations.
1. All religions are not similar in that they worship a sacred being (buddhism doesnt) but are similar in that they seperate the sacred and profane.
	- Any object or idea can be identified with the sacred, this is seen with bread in Christianity
- It is absolute separation from the profane and its inapproachability with impunity characterizes the sacred—the biblical story of Uzzah, who touched the ark of God and died on the spot, reminds us of this—and the core of religion lies in this separation.
	> "A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them." (Durkheim, [1915] 1965:62)
- Durkheim traces our sense of the sacred by looking at totems and their role in aboriginal clans.
	- Clans distinguish groups by names like “the people of the white eagle.” The name represents the clan’s totem, which serves as the emblem of the clan and appears on its property and the bodies of its members.
	- More than just a name or an emblem, however, the totem is sacred and there are ritual prohibitions that surround it such as a taboo against eating it. These tribal peoples base their entire cosmologies, their classifications of human beings and nature, on the totem, thus imposing a sacred/profane structure on the entire universe.
- Where do people develop sacred symbols in the first place? Durkheim says the totem symbolizes two things: the totemic principal (God) and the clan
	- “So if it is once the symbol of the god and of the society, is that not because the god and the society are only one?” (236). In other words, The god of any group is the group itself
- Religious force comes not from a totem or a god but from the experience of the social. Religion, therefore, encompasses the system of ideas by which people represent their society.

## Culture as Collective Representation

- Durkheim's analysis of religion points to all cultural objects as collective representation as thye not only represent a society but social experience itself
- Culture, including religion, is a collective representation in two senses. First, the cultural objects we began with (a painting, movie, prophecy, an idea) are not simply created by an individual out of thin air. Instead, people influenced by other people produce them. Second, in their cultural products, people represent their experiences of work, joy, pain, and love. Durkheim’s cultural theory gives us the social mechanism whereby cultural creators produce a cultural object greater than the sum of its influences
- To understand a certain group of people, one would look for the expressive forms through which they represent themselves to themselves
- In the example of Bessie Smith, (influential blues singer) how is her music collective representation?
	- Like many other cultural object creators, the story of the individual represent group experience. Singing of death, while personal, is ultimately universally relatable and unifying.

## Collective Production of Culture

- Durkheims insights on how culture is produced and transfered is called the **collective production** approach to cultural meanings
	- This approach tries to take away the mystery about the creation of art, ideas, beliefs, religion, and culture in general by revealing the many social activities, such as interaction, cooperation, organization, and contestation, involved in the formation of what we designate as cultural objects.
- Collective production theory has 2 sides:
	1. First side involves the interactions among people and how these interactions themselves generate culture (this stems from **symbolic interactionism**, see below for more on this)
	2. Second side looks less at interactions and more at the organization of cultural producers and consumers, including such things as culture industries, distribution mechanisms, and the markets for cultural products

## Symbolic Interactionism

- Symbolic interactionism concerns how people actively construct and learn their norms and roles
- The basic insight of the interactionists holds that the human self is not a preexisting Platonic form but is shaped through social interaction
	- An early theorist of this school was **Charles Horton Cooley**, who coined the term **“looking-glass self”**
- According to Cooley, an interaction has 3 phases:
	1. The self imagines another’s response to his or her behavior or appearance
	2. The self imagines the other person’s judgment
	3. The self has an emotional reaction, such as of pride or shame, to that judgment
	- Ex: A little girl runs and bumps into a boy in her playgroup. The girl observes the boy’s expression of pain and anger, and she imagines that he thinks her clumsy or thoughtless. She understands his probable judgment of her action (he may say, “Hey, watch out,” or give her a scornful look), and she responds emotionally (she feels embarrassed or ashamed at having hurt him or provoked his anger). Such interactions establish the norm of apologizing when accidentally bumping into someone else, for the apology constitutes a second interaction sequence to restore the social harmony that the first disrupted.
- All social learning does not take place through two-person interactions, of course. George Herbert Mead pointed out that the developing child first learns to take the role of another person.
	- This constitutes the “play” stage; the child plays at being a teacher or plays with an imaginary friend.
	
	- Later comes the more complicated “game” stage, wherein the child learns to take on and take into account a variety of other roles. Mead used the analogy of the baseball game: A player must know what any other player will do. Children move from play to games as they develop more complex responses to those with whom they do or might interact
	- Ultimately, the child learns to take into account the response of the **"generalized other"**, Mead’s term for the society
- Human biology governs little of our lives, instead humans develop their own guidelines through organized society and interaction with others
- Symbolic interactionism suggests that human interactions create culture
	- Once created, cultural objects are perpetuated and transmitted through their repeated expression and the socialization of new group members such as young/growing children
- Ones identity of self develops through their interactions with others. A blues singer "becomes" a blues singer through interactions and performances not by inate talent for the genre for instance
- **Erving Goffman** analyzed this process by using the metaphors of theatrical performances: When it interacts, the self is an actor performing a role before an audience. If the performance succeeds, the self confirms a certain identity both to her partners in interaction and to herself.

## Subcultures

- Mead  identified two types of social groups:
	1. Abstract social groups, such as debtors, that function as social groups only indirectly
	2. Concrete social classes/subgroups, such as political parties, clubs, and corporations
	- Both are actually functioning social units, in terms of which of their individual members are directly related to one another. If these relations to one another prove strong enough to counteract some of the influences of the societal generalized other, the group becomes a subculture.
- Subcultures exists within a larger cultural system and have contact with the external culture. Within any subculture’s domain operates a powerful set of symbols, meanings, and behavioral norms, often opposite of those in the larger culture of generalized other, that bind the subculture’s members
	- One might reference weed culture, biker gang culture, hiphop culture, gay bsdm culture as **"subcultures""**
- Teenagers especially flock to, and produce, subcultures, for they have the means to express themselves through consumption, they desire to differentiate themselves from other age groups and even other teenagers, and they are not yet anchored by the institutions of adult life
- Subcultures, with their elaborate symbols and meanings, develop by people interacting with one another and therefore have been of great interest to sociologists oriented toward symbolic interactionism
- Subcultures make meaning, producing cultural objects significant to insiders and mystifying to outsiders
- Opposite to resisting mainstream culture, some cultures can bolster it
	- Ex: Kids baseball team has rituals, language, and other aspects that set it asside as a subculture, it also values socially universal ideals such as valuing winning, or consuming cultural objects such as folk songs

## Cultural Innovation & Social Change

- While rare many social movements start out as subcultures
	- To use Weber’s terms, they move from the separation of otherworldly asceticism to the reforming or even revolutionary engagement of innerworldly asceticism.
	- China offers a good example of how a separatist subculture became a movement for revolutionary social change. What became known as the Boxer Uprising of 1900 began as the Spirit Boxers, a subculture of peasant youth during the late Qing dynasty who were devoted to martial arts and a ritual involving the divine possession of a believer by one of the popular gods

## Cultural Lags & Leads

- Essentially what influences what in society and how fast do trends catch up to changes in the social world
- The “cultural lag” hypothesis was put forward by a sociologist named **William Ogburn**, who maintained that sociologists should distinguish between “material culture” and “adaptive culture.”
	- Material culture is just what it sounds like: “home, factories, machines, raw materials, manufactured products, food stuffs and other material objects. When this material culture changes, the nonmaterial culture, which includes practices, folkways, and social institutions, must change in response.
	- Adaptive culture comprises the portion of nonmaterial culture that adjusts to material conditions.
	- It always takes awhile for the adaptations to catch up with material changes, and this gap is the “cultural lag.”
- Ogburn believed that changes in the material culture usually precede changes in the adaptive culture. In some sense, this is true by definition (adaptation means adapting to something). **Such a belief fits reflection theory in both its functionalist and Marxian forms**
	- At the same time, we can easily come up with examples wherein nonmaterial culture leads, not lags behind, material conditions such as worldwide rapid decline of smoking despite having no material shortage of tobaco nor any material discovery (they already knew smoking was bad) that could lead to a rapid trend of declining smoking habits for an entire population.

## Cultural Innovations

- The collective production approach to culture suggests, although innovations may occur randomly and unpredictably, some patterns as evident:
	1. Certain periods prove more likely to generate innovations than others
	2. Even the innovations follow some conventions
	3. Certain innovations prove more likely than others to become established.

## Chapter Summary

# Week 7 - Culture and Collective Identity (Chapter 5)

## Key Lecture Questions

- What is a social problem? How does it become one and how does culture play a role in that?
- What are collective identities? How are they created and what role do they play in social problems?
- How is sexual

## What is a Social Problem?

- Negative consequence
- Objective reality
- Subjective reality
- Many issues in society are not always viewed as social problems.
- There are not always concessions’ on how they are viewed
- Subjective reality can change depending on group, time etc..

- **Social Problems are subjective as they reflect the views and opinions of a society**
	- Teen pregnancy in the US is a social problem however teen pregnancy in Nigeria is desireable; a woman growing older without birthing is seen as a Nigerian social problem by comparison that doesnt exist
- One can apply a cultural diamond to social problems

> If we set up the cultural object to be, for example, (1) “illegal drugs entering America and threaten­ing its citizens,” we are appealing to an audience of Americans fearful of attacks on their way of life. We are invoking images of contamination from foreign sources. We are implying solutions: declaring a national “war” on drugs, strengthening the national defense against penetration by drugs, and taking military action against the foreign producers. It is not surprising that the creators of this cultural object are the federal government. Cultural creators create problems for which they have solutions, and governments know how to wage war. If the drug problem were defined differently so that the cultural object was (2) “poverty and despair that prompt a narcotic­ induced withdrawal from reality,” the solution would not be war but relieving poverty and despair, something that governments are less success­ ful at doing.

- A cultural object is an interpretation, a set of meanings that fit a context of ideas and institutions, that translate random happenings into events, and that suggest attitudes and actions. Social problems are cul­tural objects in exactly this sense.

## Constructing a social problem

- Social construction of reality
- Perter Berger & Thomas Luckman
- When we are within society we base our behaviours is habitual
	- Ex: people going to university
- The basic idea is that reality is a social constructions
- **Social problems are cultural objects**
	- Produces by certain groups and received by certain groups
- Situations defined as real are real in their consequences (Thomas theorem)
	- People behavior is determined by their understanding of their reality behind them
	- Ex: teen = vagabonds (idea) but then they will eventually act like this
- Donilee loseke:
	-“conditions are not social problems until humans categorize them as troublesome and in need of repair.”
	- Creator: “claim makers” > receivers: audience, cultural object: social problem
- Meaning and understanding of a social problem is not inherit to the issue but constructed by a group.

## Stephen Higartner and Charles Bosk

- “The rise and fall of social problems”
	- Ex: Syrian refugees, marijuana
- Which issues are more likely to be defined as social problems?
	- Dramatic
	- Align with core values
	- Linked with powerful interest groups

## Framing

> “A frame is an interpretive scheme that enables people to make sense of what they experience” (Goffman p.110)

- Basically people use "frames" to understand what is happening around them. The frames through which individuals make sense of themselves and the world around them depend almost entirely on one's social location, status, culture, gender, race, etc. etc. The way that I would make sense of something may be entirely different than the way my neighbor makes sense of the same thing.
- Goffman is basically saying that "ways of seeing/knowing" depend almost entirely on one's own personal experiences throughout life. Therefore, differently positioned people and social groups may "frame" (or perceive) poverty and the solutions to it differently than others. 
- Boundaries within they comprise their ideas
- Within the framing of social question is a solution
- Drunk driving as social problem, solution is more strict laws about drunk driving.
- Abigail Saguay ask:
	- How is fatness framed as a social problem?
	- Immorality frame: moral weakness
	- Medical frame: fat as a medical problem
	- Public health crisis: obesity epidemic, life expectancy, more social, invention with governments
	- Reframing the problem: humiliating fat people is hazardous to our health

# Week 8 - Organizational Culture (Chapter 6)

## Culture in Organizations

- What is culture in organizations?
	- The “value, norm and patterns of action that characterize the social relationships within formal organizations” (Chan 20150
- Common culture and cultural sameness within an organization contributes to effectiveness of organizations
	- Can also contribute to blind spots

## Cultivating Work Cultures: Management Motivational Strategies

- Structural solutions: less hierarchy
- Recruitment
	- Actively hiring a certain type of person
- Socialization
	- Instilling certain behaviours through activities, rituals etc...
- Rituals
	- Ex: Namaing of employee of the month
- Model actors
- They don’t have full control over workplace culture
- Through structural changes

### The Managed Heart

- Key sociological study of how managers cultivate work cultures
- Arlie hochschild
- Reveal the emotional side of worker socialization
- Learn the **“feeling rules”** of organizational culture
- Feeling rules guide how employee express or don’t express emotions (smiling, being cheerful, kind)

- The study of flight attendants
	- flight attendants do “emotional labour” as their sole job is to ensure a smooth flight for passengers through being happy and outgoing
	- How in different work place has to perform emotional labour,
	- Women often perform more emotional labour than men
 
## Cultivating work cultures: Workers Culture

- How do workers create own work culture (micro level)?
- Symbolic interactionist
- Gary Allan fone: **“shopfloor culture”**
	- Studied meteorologist (weather people)
	- The culture of the ground of the workers
	- Occupational identities grew out from their local work cultures
	- In Chicago they saw them selves as local scientist
	- Showing that they are all meteorologist, but have different cultures
- Also: cultures of solidarity or idiocultures
	- Ex: union, firefighters, cops,

## Summary of How Culture Impacts Organizations

### Culture and Motivation

- Organizations need to motivate their employees to behave in ways beneficial to the organization’s goals.
- Both internal subcultures of work groups and external cultural influences can interfere with this process by motivating different types of behavior.
- Management needs to create an organizational culture using some combination of structural means, recruitment, socialization, rituals, model actors, and illuminating stories so that the desired behavior becomes meaningful and satisfying to the employees

### Organizational Subcultures

- In spite of managerial efforts to exert normative control by creating an organizational culture, subcultures emerge that to some extent resist the dominant culture imposed by management.
- Such subcultures and the stories they tell often reproduce social cleavages of class, ethnicity, and gender.
- Within a particular organization, each subculture is both a meaning-making unit, such as Fantasia’s nurses, and a medium through which meanings from the external culture find expression and enactment.
- If we consider a new product, program, or policy as a cultural object, we can anticipate some of the different meanings that object will have for different groups and their implications for attitudes and behavior.

### Cross-Cultural Differences

- People’s ways of thinking and acting vary enormously from place to place, and much scholarly ink has been spilled trying to assess the impact these variations have on organizational effectiveness.
- In the past, a culturalist model, which claimed that national or local cultural values explained organizational differences, opposed a structuralist model, which contended that similar organizational structures produced similar consequences regardless of culture.
- Recent thinking has moved beyond the either/or terms of these two models to explain how culture influences structure and how structures are interpreted through cultures.

### Organizations in Multicultural Environments

- Organizations that operate in more than one country or involve several cultural groups in a single country face multiple systems of meaning creation.
- Although managers cannot control the cognitive frames that will make their organization’s products and programs meaningful in different cultures, they can first recognize this lack of control rather than assume that the characteristics and meanings of something like a Big Mac are transparent and unitary.
- Second, managers can anticipate when meaning construction will seriously challenge the goals of the organization and act in light of this understanding.
- All such levels of cultural contention suggest that success in a firm, an
NGO, or a government bureaucracy may rest as much on cultural sensitivity
and flexibility as it does on the mastery of finance and law.

# Week 9 - Culture of Connection & Digital Culture (Chapter 7)

## Key Lecture Questions:

- What impact do new information technologies have of culture? On community, on society and on the self?
- What are some of they central paradoxes that emerge with digital world, and with social media apps like Facebook in particular? How can we tackle these with sociological ideas and theories?

## Cultural Communities

- Communities can be understand 2 ways sociologically:
	1. Community as a **territorial concept**
	2. Community as a **relational concept**

### Territorial Concept

- A community is something we can locate on a map.
	- It has spatial properties: borders, a center, and outskirts. It also has a name and a set of symbols associated with it.

### Relational Concept

- Community in a relational sense refers to people who are tied
together by webs of communication and may not be physically collectivised together like a village community might be
	- Ex: Jewish community, Gay community, academic community, etc.
- In the past, there was considerable overlap between territorial and relational types of community as people who lived in
the same town or village were also linked with one another through friendship, kinship, trade, shared beliefs, and a common set of symbols.

## History of Communication

1, Oral
2. Written
3. Print
4 ICT

## ICT

- Third great communication revolution before the invention of the printing press and phonetic alphabet
- Encompasses many technologies both two way (phonecalls, facetime, fax) and one way (TV, radio, music)
- All ICT technologies have common attributes:
	1. They connect people over distances, often instantly
	2. They allow the raw expression of emotion and thought through the convenience of immediacy only previously occurring with face-to-face communication
	3. They democratize cultural access in spacial and temporal terms
	4. They democratize cultural access based on education
	5. They have a strong impact on language

## Impact of the Internet

- A decade ago in their introduction to The Internet in Everyday Life, Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite (2002) reviewed the research on Internet use in the opening years of the twenty-first century and found the following:
	- Increasing access: More people are going online. The digital divide between more affluent and less affluent members of Western countries is closing. Globally there is still considerable unevenness, with leaders like the Nordic and Baltic nations and laggards like sub-Saharan Africa, but the trend is toward ever-greater access.
	- Increasing commitment: People are spending more time online and doing more things while they’re there. While new users may at first confine their activities to e-mail, the more experienced people become, the greater their variety of online activities.
	- Domestication: No longer just a workplace tool, the Internet has followed people home.
	- Longer work hours. Since the Internet has entered the domestic space, it has also facilitated bringing work into the home, which is no longer “a haven in a heartless world.”
	- Schoolwork: Schools have been the institutional link between the home and the Internet. Not only do students use the Internet more, but also the presence of school-aged children dramatically increases the likelihood that the household will have Internet access.
	- Keeping up: Non-Internet users, a vanishing breed, report that they would like to have Internet access to “keep up.”
	- A networked society:
	 Networks, not bounded groups, are the most socially meaningful formation in the Internet age.

## The Online World: Paradoxes and Contradictions

- In a connected, digital world, are we more lonely? Are we more connected?
- Does digital culture create more unity across societies, more understanding? Or does it create more fragmentation and emphasis on differences

## Sociological Theory and Facebook

- What can sociological theory tell us about what you are doing on Facebook?
- Understanding our object of analysis:
	- What is Facebook
	- Why and how do we use it?
		- Connect to people who are far away
		- Curiosity about what people are up to
		- Keep up with events
		- Like pages
		- Entertainment purposed
		- Advertising
	- What are its benefits?
		- Current events
	- What are its drawbacks?
		- You’re only getting a certain type of information that you are more prone too
		- Dependent for self worth (likes, comments)

## Constructing Facebook Identities

- Symbolic interactionism:
	- We create meaning and identitjes through social interaction with others
- How do specific Facebook activities work to present you as a certain kind of person
- What aspects of your identity do you highlight on Facebook, and what do you keep to yourself
- Erving Goffman: **dramaturgical theory**:
	- We all engage in impression management to present ourselves in certain ways
		- In social media there are tools that make impression management easier such as deleting certain things, choosing what to post, clean up your profile, choose a particular theme
	- Performing social scripts associated with
	- Certain roles
	- Front stage vs back stage
		- Front stage is what you want people to see
		- Back stage private, audience does not have access to
	- We manage multiple selves for different audience
	- Negotiate conflicting roles
	- Within various relational communities
- Curating the exhibition of the self has become a 24/7 occupation (Marche 2012)
	- In what ways could this impression management be seen as empowering
	- If we construct meaning and identities through interaction with others, then are our online
identities less real?
- How are our online identities shaped by our social location?
	- Nakamura
		- Cybertypes:
	- The distinctive ways that the internet propagates disseminates, and commodifies images of race and racism
	- E.g. how might cultural understanding of masculinity and femininity shape what is deemed an acceptable profile picture?

## From micro to macro

- Marxist theory:
	- Approaches society as a power struggle
	- Focuses on capitalist relations of inequality
	- Examines how powerful groups maintain their power as well as how they are resisted.
	- How is Facebook linked to broader social structures like capitalism
	- Who benefits from your Facebook activities? At whose expense
	- How does Facebook sustain or challenge social inequalities

## Facebook as unpaid labour?

- Nicole Cohen
	- A political economy of Facebook
	- Facebook generates revenue predominantly from advertising that, thanks to personal information provided in member profiles, is precisely targeted to certain groups

## Beyond Facebook: Relations of Power in Digital Economies

- Blurred line between producer and consumer
	- "Prosumer"
- In the so called information age... asymmetronical power relations are being established between those who produce content and those who profit from it (Cohen 2008)

# Week 10 - Power and Culture (Chapter 8)

# Week 11 - Culture and Consumption

## Process of Commoditization

> I. Kopytoff ~ Commodities are not just materially produced - they are also culturally produced!

> Process of Commoditization ~ "commodities must not be only produced materially as things, but also culturally marked as being a certain kind of thing" (Kopytoff 1986: 64)

## Commodities

- Commodities hold value
- Can be exchanged for something that has equivilent value (Kopytoff 1986: 68)
- Culture's role? Makes products **singular**: process of singularization
	- Culture plays a role in making products unique, meaningful
	- Culture makes products that were once unimportant, into culturally significant and **singular** hierlooms

## Cultures Role for Commodities

1. To mark an object as a commodity and...
2. To mark an object as singular or special

- Social life of things: how things enter and exit the sphere of exchange
- Singularization: process that makes things unique

## Can Everything be Commoditified?

- Anything can and has been labelled with value and owned and exchanged at some point in time
	- Countries have been traded
	- People have been bought
	- Nature and national parks could have entrance fees and someone is benefiting
- Anything can have value therefor anything can be a commodity

# Week 12 - Food Culture
