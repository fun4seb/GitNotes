# SOCI250 - Consumer Culture

# Process of Commoditization

> I. Kopytoff ~ Commodities are not just materially produced - they are also culturally produced!

> Process of Commoditization ~ "commodities must not be only produced materially as things, but also culturally marked as being a certain kind of thing" (Kopytoff 1986: 64)

# Commodities

* Has value
* Can be exchanged for something that has equivilent value (Kopytoff 1986: 68)
* Culture's role? Makes products **singular**: process of singularization
  - Culture plays a role in making products unique, meaningful
  - Culture makes products that were once unimportant, into culturally significant and **singular** hierlooms

# Cultures Role for Commodities

1. To mark an object as a commodity and...
2. To mark an object as singular or special

* Social life of things: how things enter and exit the sphere of exchange
* Singularization: process that makes things unique

# Can Everything be Commoditified?

* Anything can and has been labelled with value and owned and exchanged at some point in time
  - Countries have been traded
  - People have been bought
  - Nature and national parks could have entrance fees and someone is benefiting
* Anything can have value therefor anything can be a commodity
